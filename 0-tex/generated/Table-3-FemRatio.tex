Figures represent coefficients on female ratio from 45 separate OLS regressions of readability scores on the ratio of female authors (papers with fewer than 50 percent female authors are classified as male, see~\autoref{gender}). (6)--(9) are estimated on the sample of papers published on or after 1990 with a primary \textit{JEL} code; (9) includes 563 articles from \textit{AER P\& P} (see~\autoref{FootnoteAERpp}). Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count (asinh), \(\text{max. }T\) fixed effects (author prominence) and \(\text{max. }t\) (author seniority). Standard errors clustered on editor in parentheses. ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
