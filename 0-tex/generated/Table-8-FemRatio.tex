            \item \textit{Notes}. \(\beta_1\) from FGLS estimation of~\autoref{equationX}. First column restricts sample to authors' first top-four publication (\(t=1\)), second column to their second (\(t=2\)), \textit{etc.} Regressions weighted by \(1/N_j\). Standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted for two-way clustering (editor and author) and cross-model correlation. Final column estimates from an unweighted population-averaged regression; error correlations specified by an auto-regressive process of order one and standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted for one-way clustering on author. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count (asinh), \(\text{max. }T\) fixed effects (author prominence) and \(\text{max. }t\) (author seniority); \(\text{\ding{51}}^3\) includes citation count (asinh) and \(\text{max. }t\), only. The variable "female ratio" defines papers with a strict minority of female authors as male-authored; for papers with 50 percent or more female authors, it is the ratio of female authors on a paper (see~\autoref{gender} for more details). ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
