Estimates are identical to those in \autoref{tableH2_FemRatio}, except that female ratio has been replaced with a dummy variable equal to 1 if a weak majority (50\% or more) of authors are female. (Papers with a minority---but positive---number of female authors are excluded.) ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
