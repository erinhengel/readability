Estimates are identical to those in \autoref{table3_FemRatio}, except that only papers by less experienced authors (defined as having three or fewer previous top-five articles) are included in the sample and female ratio has been replaced with the interaction between female ratio and a dummy variable equal to 1 if a female author had strictly more top-five papers as her co-authors at the time the paper was published. (Mixed-gendered papers with a senior male co-author are excluded.) ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
