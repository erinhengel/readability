Estimates are identical to those in \autoref{table4_FemRatio}, except that female ratio has been replaced with a dummy variable equal to 1 if the paper is solo-authored by a woman and 0 if it is solo-authored by a man. (Co-authored mixed-gendered papers are included and classified as male.) ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
