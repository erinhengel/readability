            \item \textit{Notes}. Table shows coefficients on female ratio (papers with fewer than 50 percent female authors are classified as male, see~\autoref{gender}) and its interaction with an indicator variable equal to one if a journal had in place an official policy of double-blind review at the time a paper was published. Results from estimating~\autoref{equation3} on the sample of articles published in 1998 or afterwards.
