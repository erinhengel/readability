            \item \textit{Notes}. Figures from first-differenced, IV estimation of~\autoref{equation1}~\citep{Arellano1995,Blundell1998} where instruments have been collapsed to create one instrument for each variable and lag distance. Female ratio (women): contemporaneous marginal effect of a paper's female co-author ratio for female authors (\(\beta_1\)); female ratio (men): analogous effect for male authors (\(\beta_1+\beta_2\)). (The variable defines papers with a strict minority of female authors as male-authored; for papers with 50 percent or more female authors, it is the ratio of female authors on a paper. See~\autoref{gender} for more details.) \textit{z}-statistics for first- and second-order autocorrelation in the first-differenced errors~\citep{Arellano1991}; null hypothesis no autocorrelation. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^2\) include citation count (asinh), \(\text{max. }T\) (author prominence) and \(\text{max. }t\) (author seniority). Standard errors clustered on author (in parentheses). ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
