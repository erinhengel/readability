Estimates are identical to those in \autoref{table4_FemRatio}, except that female ratio has been replaced with a dummy variable equal to 1 if a weak majority (50\% or more) of authors are female. (Mixed-gendered papers with a strict minority of female authors are included and classified as male-authored papers.) ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
