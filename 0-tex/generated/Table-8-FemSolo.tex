            \item \textit{Notes}. Estimates are similar to those in~\autoref{tableH2_FemRatio}, except that female ratio has been replaced with a dummy variable equal to 1 if the paper is solo-authored by a woman and 0 if it is solo-authored by a man. (Co-authored papers are excluded.) Due to small sample sizes, columns \(t=3\) and \(t=4\text{--}5\) have been combined and estimates are clustered on author, only. ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
