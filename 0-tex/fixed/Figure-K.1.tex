		\floatfoot{\tiny \textit{Notes}. Sample restricted to senior authors on a paper (5,007 observations). Blue dots are the coefficients on female ratio (papers with fewer than 50 percent female authors are classified as male, see~\autoref{gender}) corresponding to separate FGLS estimations of~\autoref{equation16} on junior ($t=1$) and senior ($t>1$) authors, respectively. The yellow dot is their difference. Vertical grey lines correspond to 90 percent confidence intervals. Regressions weighted by $1/N_j$.}
