		\floatfoot{\tiny \textit{Notes}. Sample 228 articles published in \textit{Econometrica}. Pink represents papers with at least one female co-author (41 articles); blue are papers with no female co-authors (187 articles). Figure shows the distribution of the time difference (in months) between a paper's release as an NBER Working Paper and its submission to \textit{Econometrica} (where it is eventually published). Observations on the right-hand-side of the \(y\)-axis were submitted to peer review first and released as working papers second; observations on the left-hand-side of the \(y\)-axis were released as working papers first and submitted to peer review second.}
