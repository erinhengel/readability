w5907|Although there is a vast literature on capital structure, economists do not yet have a fully satisfactory theory of debt finance (or of the differences between debt and equity). One of the reasons for this Is that debt is a security with several characteristics: a debtor typically promises a creditor a noncontlngent payment stream; provides the creditor with the right to foreclose on the debtor's assets in a default state; and gives the creditor priority in bankruptcy. It is unclear whether all these characteristics are equally important, and whether they necessarily have to go together. In this paper we develop a model based on the second characteristic of debt --- the foreclosure right --- although our model implicitly has something to say about the other two characteristics as well. We consider an entrepreneur who needs funds from an investor (eg, a bank) to finance an investment project.
w2374|Recent literature in international trade has emphasized that trade barriers often result from political objectives. These include the desire of politicians to satisfy a majority of voters {Mayer, 1984), or respond to special interest lobbying groups.1 The empirical basis for these models is well established (see Baldwin, 1986). It is surprising, however, that this literature has focused on a small country setting trade barriers without any foreign repercussions. Thus, while the interests of domestic groups are of critical importance, those of foreigners have only recently been considered. For example, Das (1986), Husted (1986) and Hillman and Ursprung (1987) examine how foreign lobbying affects domestic trade policy. In this paper we shall consider a home government with political pressure to restrict trade, at the expense of foreigners. The foreign country is compensated with an income transfer, which can be thought of as a portion of the tariff revenues or quota rents. In this setting the two countries should negotiate over the level of tariff and transfer of rents, depending on the level of political pressure at home.
w15394|A classic question in macroeconomics is: what is the size of the governmentspending multiplier? There is a large empirical literature that grapples with this question. Authors such as Barro (1981) argue that the multiplier is around 0.8 while authors such as Ramey (2008) estimate the multiplier to be closer to 1.2.1 There is also a large literature that uses general-equilibrium models to study the size of the government-spending multiplier. In standard new-Keynesian models the government-spending multiplier can be somewhat above or below one depending on the exact specification of agent's preferences (see Gali, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007) and Monacelli and Perotti (2008)). In frictionless real-business-cycle models this multiplier is typically less than one (see eg Aiyagari, Christiano, and Eichenbaum (1992), Baxter and King (1993), Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004), Ramey and Shapiro (1998), and Ramey (2008)). Viewed overall it is hard to argue, based on the literature, that the government-spending multiplier is substantially larger than one. In this paper we argue that the government-spending multiplier can be much larger than one when the nominal interest rate does not respond to an increase in government spending.
w7051|Economists usually evaluate policies with reference to individualistic notions of social welfare, under which assessment of policies depends exclusively upon their effects on individuals' utilities. In contrast, ordinary citizens and many government decisionmakers tend to believe that individuals' utilities are not the only relevant consideration in determining which policies society ought to adopt. They often regard other principles as important in their own right. Thus, individuals' rewards should be based on merit or desert, punishment should fit the crime, and so forth.1 In addition, economists (such as Musgrave and Sen) sometimes advance social welfare functions that depart from purely individualistic ones.2 In this note, we show that, for any non-individualistic social welfare function, there always exist circumstances in which the Pareto principle is violated.3 That is, any conceivable notion of social welfare that does not depend solely on individuals' utilities wiU sometimes require adoption of a policy that makes every person worse off. Thus, the tension between concern for individuals' well-being and conceptions of social welfare that give weight to factors apart from individuals' utilities is sharper than may have been apparent. 2. Analysis Let x denote a complete description of the world.
w14153|Whether competition in health insurance markets leads to effcient outcomes is a central question for health policy. Markets are effective when prices direct consumers and firms to behave effciently. But in health insurance markets, prices often do not reflect the different costs of coverage for different enrollees in different health plans. This lack of information in prices generates two concerns. If insurers receive premiums that do not reflect enrollee risk, they have an incentive to engage in risk selection through plan design (Rothschild and Stiglitz, 1976; Newhouse, 1996). Similarly, if consumers face prices that do not reflect cost differences across plans, they may select coverage ine.
w14035|The question of how households change their economic behavior when they receive a temporary income shock is of great importance for macroeconomic and fiscal policy, and for one of the most influential hypotheses in economics the permanent income hypothesis (PIH). A second influential hypothesis in the discipline has been the notion that households' consumption behavior is directly affected by their neighbors, via competitive or imitative processes; see for example Leibenstein (1950), Pollak (1976), Bagwell and Bernheim (1996), and Becker and Murphy (2001). Finally, a fundamental prediction of consumer theory is the notion that households who receive extramarginal in-kind transfers should, if possible, attempt to undo those transfers by converting them to cash (eg Moffitt 1984, 1989). To date, empirical testing of all the above hypotheses has yielded less-than-definitive results, due in part to the lack of credibly exogenous variation in either a household's own income, or in either the income or consumption of its neighbors. Recently, however, progress on testing the PIH has been made by using the random timing of income tax rebates (Agarwal, Liu and Souleles 2007). Regarding social effects, a number of recent studies have used plausibly exogenous variation to study social and neighborhood effects, such as Sacerdote's (2001) study of (randomly assigned) college room mates, and social experiments such as Moving to Opportunity which randomly assign households to neighborhoods (Katz et al. 2001, Kling et al. 2005, Ludwig et al. 2001). To our knowledge however, none of these newer studies of social effects focus specifically on household consumption. We are aware of no experimental tests of simple models of transfers in kind. In this paper we contribute to all the above research questions using data from the Dutch Postcode Lottery (PCL). Each week, this lottery allocates a prize to participants in a randomly chosen postcode (containing 19 households on average). About one third of the Dutch population participates in the lottery. A participant wins 12,500 per ticket. In addition, one of the participants wins a BMW. From an experimental design perspective, the lottery provides PCL participants in the winning code with an unexpected temporary income shock equal on average to about eight months of income, while leaving all other households' incomes unchanged.
w2756|Two major trends have dominated the post war history of trade policy in industrialized countries. One is the dramatic multilateral reduction in tariffs negotiated under the GATT. The other is the move toward "special" protection that has occurred as the industrialized countries of the world have become more integrated and as volatility in trade flows has become a more important source of domestic disruption. The rise in special forms of protection is epitomized by the growing use of Voluntary Export Restraints (VERs), Orderly Market Arrangements (OMAs), and tariffs that are tailor made to suit the needs of particular sectors. These policy tools are typically utilized by countries to limit the rate of expansion of imports or exports from that which would occur absent intervention. The term "managed trade" is often invoked to characterize the current international trading environment, since it consists of a relatively low "baseline" or "normal" level of protection combined with the use of special protection to dampen underlying changes in trade flows. The low baseline level of protection sustained by countries suggests that a standard non-cooperative Nash equilibrium view is inadequate to explain existing levels of protection. One alternative way to view the existing trading environment is that it is the result of explicit agreements among countries. This approach to explaining levels of protection has been taken by Mayer (1981) and Riezman (1982).
w0686|In their classic 1950 analysis of the international transmission of business cycles under flexible exchange rates,1 Svend Laursen and Lloyd A. Metzler hypothesized a relationship between aggregate spending and the terms of trade that has come to occupy an important place in open-economy macroeconomics. This Laursen-Metzler effect was central to the early post-war writing on the theory of devaluation---notably that of Harberger [1950] and Alexander [1952]---and has, more recently, emerged in discussion of the external adjustment problem accompanying shifts in the io?.ative pric2 of manufactured and primarry commodities. 2 It predicts that an adverse movement in the terms of trade between domestic and foreign goods will cause a rise in the home-goods value of expenditure, and, under conditions of complete specialization in production, a current-account deficit. Laursen and Metzler based their hypothesis largely on statistical evidence that seemed to confirm Keynes' "fundamental psychological law" positing a stable relationship between current real income and consump-3 tion. According to this law, individuals adjust only gradually to a decline in real income, reducing saving as well as spending in an attempt to smooth their consumption stream.
w3188|The wage rate is often seen as one of the most important prices in the economy. It shapes the distribution of income, the levels of employment and unemployment, and the participation and effort decisions of individual workers. Despite its apparent significance, however, the wage determination process remains complex and controversial. Some ideas, such as the Phillips curve, have received extraordinary scrutiny. Other issues, such as wage rigidity theorems, hysteresis and the bargaining framework which determines wageffemployment outcomes, have received little empirical attention. This paper has two principal novel aspects. It studies the effects on real wages of (i) the level of unemployment and (ii) industry product prices. The conceptual framework underlying this approach is a bargaining analysis in which rents are divided between the firm and the trade union.
w6741|It has become commonplace to observe that a large fraction of world trade takes place between countries with similar aggregate factor endowments and similar technological capabilities. Moreover, much of this trade involves goods with similar factor intensities. Explanations for these observations abound. Increasing returns to scale can account for trade in goods that are technologically alike but differentiated in the eyes of consumers (eg, Krugman, 1979). Oligopolistic competition can account for two-way trade in identical products under certain assumptions about oligopolistic conduct (eg, Brander, 1991). Small technological differences across countries can account for high volumes of trade in goods with similar factor intensities when factor endowment ratios are similar and there are more goods than factors (Davis, 1995). But all of these explanations share the implication that the pattern of trade is essentially arbitrary.
w15481|Asset price bubbles, ie, asset prices that exceed assets' fundamental values, have always been a subject of interest to economists. However, clear identification of a price bubble is challenging due to the difficulty of measuring an asset's fundamental value. There is an open debate about whether each historical episode constitutes a bubble. For example, Garber (2000) proposes market fundamental explanations for three famous bubbles, the Dutch tulip mania (1634-37), the Mississippi bubble (1719-20) and the closely connected South Sea bubble (1720). Pastor and Veronesi (2006) challenge the existence of an Internet bubble in the late 1990s. The difficulty of measuring asset fundamentals makes it even more challenging to analyze economic mechanisms that drive up price bubbles. Instead, the academic literature heavily relies on laboratory settings to study asset bubbles. In this paper, we use a unique data sample from China's warrants market to study asset price bubbles. In 2005-08, several Chinese companies issued put warrants with long maturities ranging from 9 months to 2 years. These warrants give their holders the right to sell the issuing companies' stocks at predetermined strike prices during a pre-specified exercise period. The dramatic stock market runup in China between 2005 and 2007 pushed most of these put warrants so deep out of the money that they were certain to expire worthless. However, they had become targets of frenzied speculation, which generated a spectacular bubble as dramatic as, if not more than, any historical bubble episode. For each warrant, billions of Yuan traded with an average daily turnover rate close to 300%, and at substantially inflated prices. Several features make these warrants particularly appealing for analyzing bubbles: First, we can reliably measure the warrants' fundamental values to be zero using the underlying stock prices; second, the publicly observable stock prices also make the zero warrant fundamentals observable to all market participants; and third, these warrants have a predetermined finite maturity. These features so far are available only in laboratory environments.
w3479|This paper dcscribcs a setup within which dynamic stochastic competitive models can quickly and inexpensively be formulated and analyzed. This kind of model is used in macroeconomics and finance to build theories about how variables like consumption, investment, asset prices, and interest rates covary over time, and how their evolution is to be interpreted in terms of parameters governing preferences, technology, and information flows. The idea here is to rig a class of economic environments with descriptions of preferences, technologies, and information structures that occur in the form of a set of matrices. By naming a particular list of matrices, we completely specify an economic environment. Given these matrices, we supply a set of easy to use computer programs that compute and characterize the competitive equilibrium prices and allocation.1 The class of models is specified so that an equilibrium can be represented as a state space system in which the state vector evolves according to a first order linear vector stochastic difference equation. This feature emerges because the models assume quadratic preferences and linear technologies and information structures. The linearity of the equilibria enables us to characterize them in terms of standard objects of time series econometrics. Thus, given a representation of our equilibrium in state space form, it is straightforward to deduce both impulse response functions with respect to the innovations impinging on agents' information sets and vector autoregressive or Wold representations for any subset of variables linearly related to the state vector.
w7927|Traditionally, each country had its own currency, and only one currency circulated in each country. Monetary unions were rare, and, therefore, the surge in the number of countries in the post-war period generated a large increase in the number of currencies circulating in the world. In 1947 there were 76 countries in the world, today there are 193, and, with few exceptions, each country has its own currency.1 Unless one believes that a country is. by definition, an "optimal currency area," either there were too few currencies in 1947 or there are too many today. In fact, the increasing integration of international markets implies that the optimal number of currencies would tend to decrease, rather than almost triple as it has. Only recently, however, and perhaps as a result of this proliferation of currencies, the sanctity of "one country one money" has come into question.
w3059|Many studies have attempted to test Heckscher-Ohlin (H-0) theory, or more generally, to infer a country's abundant resources, by regressing industry trade balances on factor input requirements in a single year. Inferences about a country's abundance in a factor are then based on the sign of its estimated coefficient. However, Anderson (1981), Learner and Bowen (1981) and Aw (1983) have demonstrated that unless each factor is specific to each industry, such inferences are inappropriate in a model with more than two factors.
w4211|This paper is motivated by three stylized facts. The first fact is that inventory movements play a dominant role in business cycle fluctuations. For example, Blinder and Maccini (1991) document that, in postwar US recessions, declines in inventory investment account for an average of 87% of the total peak-to-trough movement in GNP. The second fact is that recessions usually follow a period of tight credit. Eckstein and Sinai (1986) argue that each of the six recessions between 1957 and 1982 was preceded by a "credit crunch"--a time of restrictive monetary policy and rising interest rates. At first glance, it would appear that these two facts can be tied together with a simple and obvious story.
w2709|We present a model of industrialization caused by an increase in agricultural productivity or by an export boom, that raise incomes and therefore demand for domestic manufactures. As domestic markets become larger, increasing returns production technologies that could not break even in smaller markets come into profitable use and industry expands. The key role of productive agriculture or exports for generating domestic demand for manufactures has been emphasized in earlier work of Rosenstein-Rodan [1943], Nurkse [1953], Lewis [1953, 1954], Ranis and Fei [1961], and especially Fleming [1953], Empirically, Ohkawa and Rosovsky fiI960] document the great increases in agricultural productivity in turn of the century Japan, and Johnston and Mellor [1961] note the importance of the demand from farmers for growth of industry during that period.
w9721|In many businesses it is customary to advertise a base price for a product or service and to try to induce customers to buy additional “add-ons” at high prices at the point of sale. The quoted price for a hotel room may not include phone calls, in-room movies, minibar items, dry cleaning, etc. Electronics stores offer extended warranties and accessories. Car rental agencies offer insurance and prepaid gasoline. New car dealers hope to service cars they sell. Add-ons need not be a separate goods. For example, a high quality mattress can be thought of as a bundle containing a low quality mattress and an add-on of additional quality. Once one starts to think broadly about add-on pricing, it can be challenge to think of a business where the practice is absent. Although many firms earn a substantial portion of their revenue from add-ons, it is not clear that we should care.1 The classic Chicago school argument would be that profits earned on add-ons will be competed away in the form of lower prices for the base good. Two formalizations of this argument can be found in the literature. Lal and Matutes (1994) develops a model of loss-leader pricing in which the Chicago view is true to an extreme – every consumer purchases the same bundle at the same price regardless of whether the prices of add-ons are or are not advertised. Verboven (1999) analyzes a model of add-on pricing with different assumptions about preferences in which add-on pricing again has no effect on profits. This paper, in contrast, argues that add-on pricing is important.
w10038|This paper constructs a simple model linking innovation rates to current and future market size, and provides evidence from the pharmaceutical industry to support this hypothesis. Our empirical work, which exploits changes in the market size for various drug categories driven by US demographic trends, finds economically significant and relatively robust effects of market size on entry of new drugs. Although many historical accounts of important innovations focus on the autonomous progress of science and on major breakthroughs that take place as scientists build on each other’s work, economists typically emphasize profit incentives and the size of the target market.
w7269|This paper characterizes the dynamic effects of shocks in government spending and taxes on economic activity in the United States in the postwar period. It does so by using a structural VAR approach that relies on institutional information about the tax and transfer systems and the timing of tax collections to identify the automatic response of taxes and spending to activity, and, by implication, to infer fiscal shocks. One would have thought that such an exercise would have been carried out already. But, as fax as we can tell, it has not. Of course, large-scale econometric models provide estimates of dynamic fiscal multipliers.
w3668|This paper analyzes a simple model of endogenous growth with distributive conflicts between labor and capital. The rate of economic growth is determined by policy decisions which are shaped by the struggle for distributive shares: we endogenize government policy in a model of endogenous growth. We focus on the political conflict between individuals who derive their income from capital and those who derive their income from labor. The government has two decisions to make: (i) the rate at which capital is to be taxed; and (ii) the distribution of government expenditures between productive public investments and lump-sum transfers to workers. Holding the composition of public expenditure constant, the economy's growth rate is increasing in taxes on capital for "small" tax rates, and decreasing in taxes for "large" rates. Thus, a strictly positive tax rate on capital maximizes the economy's growth rate. On the other hand, holding the tax rate constant, growth is reduced by an increase in redistribution through transfers to workers, who supply labor inelastically.
w2068|As is now well understood, the requirement that policies be time consistent leads to outcomes that are suboptimal relative to those that precommitment would sustain. An example considered by Fischer (1980) is capital taxation in a two-period model. In that model a second period capital levy is first best from the perspective of period two, but third best from the perspective of period one. Since there is nothing in Fischer's model to enforce a government commitment against second period capital taxation, the ex post desire to engage in first best taxation drives the ex ante economy from a second to a third best outcome. Researchers have suggested a variety of ways to enforce optimal commitment policies. Kydland and Prescott (1977) argue for rules rather than discretion. Barro and Gordon (1983) and a number of subsequent writers (see Rogoff (1986)) introduce government reputation as a mechanism to enforce commitment.
w3844|Textbook aggregate demand models suggest simple relationships between the government budget and economic activity, a cut in the government deficit, for example, depressing consumption and output. Though such models heavily influence the design of stabilization policies, their microfoundations are unclear and their sharp predictions are not always consistent with reality. In many countries, large cuts in government spending carried out as part of stabilization programs have led to expansions rather than contractions in economic activity. The absence of simple relationships between economic variables is often explained theoretically by the importance of expectations of future economic variables, including variables reflecting government policy. The idea that expectations of future policy changes are crucial in understanding seemingly counterintuitive macroeconomic dynamics has been explored before. It formed the basis of the now classic Sargent and Wallace paper on "Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic" (1981). More recently, Drazen and Helpman considered the effects of future anticipated fiscal changes meant to balance the budget on current inflation in a closed economy (1990) and the current account in an open economy (1987).
w5163|The spatial concentration of wealth in America is striking. The average income of the richest census tracts is over 25 times larger than the average income of the poorest census tracts. In the city of Detroit, 40 percent of the population is without a high school degree, 47 percent is not in the labor force, median household income is $ 21,000 and 59 people per 100,000 are murdered annually. In the city of Boston, less than 20 percent of the population is without a high school degree, two-thirds of the population is in the labor force, and the median income is $ 32,000. The murder rate is one-third as high. The concentration of poverty seems to cry out for government policy responses.
w3942|What are the coats of financial distress? There are as many answers as models. Ln truth, no one knows, though these costs are presumed to be a central component of capital structure decisions. Indeed, we do not even know much about what companies do when they get into financial trouble. This paper begins to fill this gap - first by documenting how companies cope with financial distress, and second by analyzing what implications these findings have for understanding the costs of financial distress. Our study is based on a sample of 102 companies that issued high-yield "junk" bonds, during the 1970s and 1980s and subsequently got into financial trouble. These companies deal with distress in one or more ways. They: (i) restructure their bank and private debt through direct negotiations; (ii) restructure their public debt with an exchange offer of cash and securities; (iii) get an infusion of new capital; (iv) sell major assets or merge; (v) reduce capital expenditures; and (vi) file for Chapter 11 reorganization.
w11551|Is the world’s capital stock efficiently allocated across countries? If so, then all countries have roughly the same aggregate marginal product of capital (M P K). If not, the M P K will vary substantially from country to country. In the latter case, the world foregoes an opportunity to increase global GDP by reallocating capital from low to high M P K countries. The policy implications are far reaching. Given the enormous cross-country differences in observed capital-labor ratios (they vary by a factor of 100 in the data used in this paper) it may seem obvious that the M P K must vary dramatically as well.
w8720|In Texas, as in most of the United States, the sale of liquor is heavily regulated. Moreover, regulations vary across different localities within the state. Some are "dry", completing prohibiting the retail sale of alcoholic beverages. Others permit the sale of only certain types of liquor or require that liquor be consumed "off premise". What is particularly interesting about Texas is that alcohol regulations at the local level are determined directly by the citizens.1 A citizen wishing to change regulations in his community can get the change voted on in a referendum. Such referenda are commonplace, with over 500 elections between 1976 and 1996. These liquor referenda appear a promising vehicle for understanding voter turnout. First, turnout varies widely. In some communities over 75% of the voting age population show up to vote, while in others turnout is less than 10%. Second, since there is a limited set of regulations that are actually proposed, the issues decided by the referenda are basically the same across jurisdictions.
w13145|Corruption is widely thought to be a major factor retarding growth in the developing world. As a result, there is substantial interest from both developing country governments and international institutions in understanding the forces that drive corrupt behavior. Most theoretical and empirical work on corruption focuses on the individual corrupt transaction  potentially corrupt officials weigh the benefits from corruption against the expected punishments if they are caught, and choose accordingly. However, the level of corruption may also be influenced by market forces. In this view, first articulated by Shleifer and Vishny (1993), corrupt officials behave like profit maximizing firms, and the level of corruption is determined by the structure of the 'market' for bribes, the elasticity of demand for the officials' services, and the degree to which corrupt officials can coordinate with one another in setting prices. This paper takes the market forces view of corruption seriously, and examines the degree to which standard pricing theories from industrial organization are consistent with actual patterns of bribes and extortion payments. We study these questions in the context of bribes paid by truck drivers on their trips to and from the Indonesian province of Aceh. Truck drivers in Aceh make a variety of illegal payments, including payments to police and military officers to avoid harassment at checkpoints along the roads, payments at weigh stations to avoid fines for driving overweight, and protection payments to criminal organizations and the police. To investigate these payments, we designed a study in which enumerators accompanied truck drivers along their regular routes to and from Aceh. From November 2005 to July 2006, enumerators accompanied drivers on a total of 304 trips to and from Aceh, and directly observed more than 6,000 illegal payments along the routes. To the best of our knowledge, this represents fi 1 The only other dataset consisting of observed bribe payments, as opposed to reported bribe payments, is McMillan and Zoido (2004), which consists of videotapes the bribe-giver (Montesinos, the head of the Peruvian intelligence under Fujimori) took to help him maintain leverage over bribe recipients later on.
w5372|The historical debate over immigration policy in the United States has focused primarily on two questions: How well do immigrants adjust to their new surroundings? And do immigrants "take jobs away" from native workers? The growth of the welfare state in the past thirty years, as well as the perception that immigrant participation in welfare programs is on the rise, has added an explosive new question to this debate: Do immigrants pay their way in the welfare state? In fact, the concern over the impact of immigration on the costs of welfare programs has led Congress to seriously consider the possibility of denying all means-tested assistance to all non-citizens, regardless of whether they entered the country legally. The available empirical evidence suggests that an increasing number of immigrants are beneficiaries of welfare programs fiBlau 1984; Jensen 1988; Boijas and Trejo 1991; and Boijas 1995], For the most part, this inference is drawn from the analysis of decennial Census data.
w19830|Arguably the most important fact of the last century is the steady rise in living standards throughout much of the world. Will this rise continue? We discuss what modern growth theory has to say about economic growth in the United States over the next 25 to 50 years. 2. The Facts Figure 1 shows GDP per person for the United States between 1870 and the present. The stability of the growth rate is remarkable and surprising, with GDP per person lying close to a linear time trend with a slope of just under 2 percent per year.
w8030|Given that consumers do not replace durables every day, it has become common to assume that purchases of durables are subject to fixed costs of adjustment. Among the fixed costs most often cited are "lemons costs."1 These costs arise because adverse selection in the secondary market reduces the price of a durable, and thereby discourages trade (Akerlof [1970]). The size of this cost depends on the distribution of quality in the secondary market, and this distribution depends on the sales decisions of consumers. In spite of the obvious endogeneity of such costs, models of durables typically assume that the fixed costs of adjustment are exogenous. The model that we present is standard except that the adjustment cost arises endogenously from adverse selection in the secondary market. In the model, consumers hold cars of various qualities. Only the owner of a car knows its true quality. There is also a parameter that characterizes the quality of the match between the car and its owner. A good match is more desirable than a poor match. Consumers may sell cars either because the quality is low or because the car is not a good match for their current needs.
w7105|In valuing financial securities in an arbitrage-free environment, one inevitably faces a trade-off between the analytical and computational tractability of pricing and estimation, and the complexity of the probability model for the state vector X. In the light of this trade-off, academics and practitioners alike have found it convenient to impose sufficient structure on the conditional distribution of X to give closed- or nearly closed-form expressions for securities prices.
w3505|Government has no single policy toward housing. Rather, it affects the equilibrium amounts of owner-occupied and rental housing through an amalgam of policies such as: direct subsidies for low-income housing, deductions allowed under the personal income tax, the progressive personal rate structure, the relative taxation of other goods and assets, and the effect of monetary policy on interest rates. Of particular interest have been the effects of tax rules on the residential capital stock and tenure choice, that is, whether to own or rent. Personal tax rules favor owner housing by exempting the imputed net rental income. Tax rules also have favored rental housing to some extent through accelerated depreciation allowances. An important indirect benefit to housing capital is the additional corporate tax on other uses of capital.
w15563|While it is intuitive that the volatilities and comovements of stocks and bonds are strongly related to the state of economic fundamentals, it is surprising that the .nancial literature has been unable to empirically demonstrate such a strong link between them, as evidenced in the following quote from a recent paper by Nobel prize laureate Robert Engle. 'After more than 25 years of research on volatility, the central unsolved problem is the relation between the state of the economy and aggregate .nancial volatility. The number of models that have been developed to predict volatility based on time series information is astronomical, but the models that incorporate economic variables are hard to .
w4490|A fundamental question in macroeconomics is how to set fiscal policy over the business cycle. Standard Keynesian models imply that fiscal policy should be countercyclical. For example, this means cutting taxes during recessions. The tax smoothing models of Barro (1979) and others imply that welfare-maximizing tax rates change only when there are unanticipated shocks that affect the government's budget constraint. Thus when there is an unanticipated decline in output, and hence tax revenues, welfare-maximizing tax rates are raised by enough to meet the government's expected present value budget constraint. In this paper we use standard neoclassical theory to answer this question. In particular, we use a quantitative version of the standard neoclassical growth model with distorting taxes.
w3220|Western European countries discussing prospects for monetary integration share a fundamental concern about the inevitable constraints on national autonomy, the problem arises, of course, because countries generally differ in their economic policy needs, while a common currency requires the deferral of all monetary policy decisions to an international Central Bank (Casella and Feinstein 1989). the debate has usually focussed on the possibility (or impossibility) of maintaining the necessary independence through fiscal policy (see for example Eichengreen 1989 and Cohen and Vyplosz 1988), but it has Ignored the study of the institutional features of this international monetary agency.
w16588|Although there is no general agreement on the primary causes of the US Great Depression--- the sharp economic contraction in the early 1930s and the subsequent slow recovery---many do agree that fiscal policy played only a minor role. This conventional view is based on both empirical and theoretical analyses of the period. Although federal government spending notably increased during the 1930s, the data show that as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), it did not increase enough to have had a large impact (Brown, 1956). At the same time, income tax rates increased sharply, but taxes were filed by few households and paid by even fewer (US Department of the Treasury, 1916-2010).
w3635|In this paper we show that countries and industries with large seasonal cycles also have large business cycles. We then discuss the elements required in a model to generate our finding and explain why the finding suggests that the economic mechanism propagating seasonal fluctuations is closely linked to that propagating business cycle fluctuations. We also propose a particular model that incorporates this property and that is consistent with our empirical result. The model is preliminary but it illustrates our main point: the robust finding that the amounts of seasonal and business cycle variation are positively correlated across sectors is likely to require an explanation in which the two kinds of fluctuations are intimately related.
w4222|One of the oldest questions in economics is that of whether the market for labor can be represented satisfactorily by a standard competitive model. The importance of this question, which has implications for macroeconomics as well as labor economics, has stimulated much earlier research and more than a little controversy. The purpose of this paper is to blend microeconomic data on wages with industrial data on profits to produce a new test of the competitive market hypothesis. The results of the study suggest that, contrary to the implications of competitive theory, US pay determination exhibits elements of rent-sharing. In a prominent early attack on traditional analysis, Sumner Slichter (1950) argued that a competitive model fails to explain the empirical evidence that apparently homogenous types of employee earn significantly different amounts in different industries. His data, drawn from the US manufacturing sector, showed that wages appeared to be positively correlated with various measures of the employer's 'ability to pay'. Slichier concluded that this correlation provides prima facie evidence against a conventional competitive model.
w11888|Why do unemployed workers and job vacancies coexist? What determines the rate at which unemployed workers find jobs? This paper advances the proposition that at any point in time, the skills and geographical location of unemployed workers are poorly matched with the skill requirements and location of job openings. The rate at which unemployed workers find jobs depends on the rate at which they retrain or move to locations with available jobs, the rate at which jobs open in locations with available workers, and the rate at which employed workers vacate jobs in locations with suitable unemployed workers.
w10679|In a liquidity trap, the nominal interest rate is zero, but the real interest rate is higher than optimal, due to private-sector expectations of low infliation or even defliation. It is well known since Krugman [12], that the optimal way to escape from a liquidity trap is to generate expectations of a higher future price level and thereby expectations of higher future infliation. This will lower the real interest rate and stimulate the economy out of the liquidity trap, even though the nominal interest rate is zero.
w3241|Why do some countries grow quickly while others do not? Why is it that some countries seem endlessly mired in poverty while other similar ones suddenly take off in a period of exponential development? Is growth affected by the taxation and foreign trade policies of governments? Can a government, through appropriate choice of policy "trigger" a spurt of growth? To what extent can we trace the success of certain countries in recent years to explicit policies on the part of their governments? These are important questions that have received considerable attention from scholars interested in growth and development. Specifically, there is a wealth of evidence describing episodes of growth and stagnation as well as the government policies in effect in each country.
w3338|0 Economists have long suspected that there is a link between national policies and long term rates of economic growth. For example, Schultz [1981J suggests that many public policies contain disincentives for growth because they reduce the rewards to accumulation of a comprehensive concept of capital encompassing human as sell as physical capital. In this paper, we show that a basic Schultzian model has the property that modest variations in tax rates are associated with large variations in long run growth rates. Our model follows leads provided by Uzawa [1965], Lucas [1988b], and Rebelo [1987]. In our analysis, changes in public policy can potentially explain periods of secular stagnation or high economic growth. Public policy is particularly powerful in affecting small open economies with freely mobile capital.
w12629|Recently, a number of studies have departed from the mainstream view that in order to explain economic fluctuations in emerging markets theoretical models must take explicitly into account the role of policy and market failures. This line of research argues that business cycles in emerging countries can be explained well using a neoclassical model featuring no distortions and driven solely by shocks to total factor productivity. Finn Kydland and Carlos Zarazaga (2002), for instance, adopt a strong view by arguing that the RBC model can replicate satisfactorily the 'lost decade' of the 1980s in Argentina.
w13540|This paper reexamines some of the themes of the incomplete contracts literature  in particular, the hold-up problem and asset ownership  through a new theoretical lens, the idea that contracts serve as reference points (see Hart and Moore (2008)). We consider a buyer and seller who are involved in a (long-term) economic relationship where the buyer's value and seller's cost are initially uncertain. For the relationship to work out the parties need to cooperate in ways that cannot be specified in an initial contract. The buyer and seller face the following trade-off. On the one hand they can write a flexible contract that attempts to index the terms of trade  price  to the state of the world. However, to the extent that value and cost are not objective, such a contract will lead to argument, aggrievement and shading; this in turn creates deadweight losses.
w5674|Twenty-nine percent of threatened birds worldwide and more than half the threatened mammals in Australasia and the Americas are subject to over-harvesting fiGoombridge, 1992]. Most models of open-access resources assume that the good is non-storable fiClark, 1976; Gordon, 1954; Schaefer, 1957]. While this may be a reasonable assumption for fish, it is inappropriate for many other species threatened by over-harvesting, as illustrated in Table I. Although 30% of threatened mammals are hunted for presumably non-storable meat, 20% are hunted for fur or hides, which are presumably storable, and approximately 10% are threatened by the live trade fiGoombridge, 1992]. African elephants are a prime example of a resource which is technologically difficult to protect as private property, and is used to produce a storable good. From 1981 to 1989, Africa's elephant population fell from approximately 1.2 million to just over 600,000 fiBarbier, et al., 1990].
w4311|In the United States a family's income, assets, education level, ethnic background and lifestyle can be predicted quite accurately from its zip code -and this in spite of the great diversity of the American population.'This strong degree of social and economic segregation, epitomized of late by the spread of gated communities, is reflected in wide disparities in the funding and quality of local public services, such as primary and secondary education or law enforcement. It also manifests itself in the increasingly different types of behavior and values to which the young are exposed during their formative years The production of goods and services thus brings together on the factory floor and at the office workers on the one hand, managers and professionals on the other, whose upbringing and levels of human capital are becoming increasingly disparate.
w0987|The effect of expected inflation on the velocity of monetary circulation is fundamental to an understanding of both the causes and effects of inflation. In explaining how monetary expansion can - particularly in hyperinflation - cause a more than proportional rise in prices, the conventional wisdom is that expected inflation leads people to economize on their real money holdings. In analyzing the costs of high inflation an important role is assigned to the costs associated with reduced real balances; ie, reduced "liquidity". In spite of the importance that is attached to the idea of a demand for real balances which depends on expected inflation, however, this idea has never been given a really secure micro-economic foundation. The standard Baumol-Tobin model of the demand for money is a model of a single individual, which has never been integrated into a description of a market. Approaches which place money in the utility function, such as Brock (1975), are suggestive but essentially assume the result. "Cash-in-advance" models, like that of Wilson (1979), seem to imply that a capital market drives monetary velocity to its technological maximum independently of the rate of inflation.
w0253|One of the most important aspects of the one^sector monetary growth model developed by Tobin (1965) is the analysis of the effect of inflation on the steady-state capital intensity and real interest rate. Tobin showed that, by lowering the real return on money, inflation makes real capital more attractive as an asset and leads to capital deepening and a lower real rate of return. By including personal and corporate income taxes in the specification of this model, Feldstein (1976) has found that the failure to index these taxes for inflation may also have a substantial impact on the economy's steady-state characteristics. One aspect of the problem which has not been adequately explored is the effect of inflation on the production decisions of firms. The current structure of the US corporate income tax has the effect of greatly distorting investment decisions among various assets. The investment tax credit may be applied to purchases of certain equipment, but not structures. Even in the absence of inflation, depreciation schedules used for tax purposes do not mirror true economic depreciation.^" With the advent of inflation, this distortion is compounded by the fact that these schedules are based on the original or "historic" cost and not the replacement cost of the capital being depreciated. ^ In the next section, we present a model of competitive firm behavior when the durability of capital is subject to choice by the firm.
w6564|In 1988, output per worker in the United States was more than 35 times higher than output per worker in Niger. In just over ten days, the average worker in the United States produced as much as an average worker in Niger produced in an entire year. Explaining such vast differences in economic performance is one of the fundamental challenges of economics. Analysis based on an aggregate production function provides some insight into these differences, an approach taken by Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) and Dougherty and Jorgenson (1996), among others. Differences among countries can be attributed to differences in human capital, physical capital, and productivity.
w6357|In the standard theory of human capital as developed by Becker (1964), there is a sharp distinction between general and specific human capital. Skills which are only useful with the current employer are specific whereas skills which are as useful with some other employer are general. In competitive labor markets, workers capture all the benefits of their general human capital, and employers have no incentive to invest in these skills. In this paper, we develop the theory of human capital when labor markets are imperfect. In contrast to the standard theory, labor market frictions imply that firms may be willing to invest in the general skills of their workers. In particular, if these frictions distort the structure of wages within the firm away from the competitive benchmark and to the benefit of unskilled workers, it will be profitable for the firm to provide workers with general skills. We find that contrary to conventional wisdom, for firms to pay for general skills, credit market problems are neither necessary nor sufficient. The key is labor market imperfections which make technologically general skills effectively specific.
w18722|Recent studies document significant persistence for a number of societal characteristics including economic outcomes like female labor force participation (Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn, forthcoming), levels of technology (Comin, Easterly and Gong, 2010), and cultural traits (Voigtlaender and Voth, 2012). This paper contributes to this line of enquiry by analyzing the persistence of institutional features over time. In particular, we examine the persistence of democracy, showing that a tradition of local-level democracy - ie, a tradition of having the local leader chosen through consensus rather than other methods such as hereditary appointment - is associated with more democratic national institutions. This is consistent both with the persistence of democratic institutions over time and with the transmission of democratic institutions from the local level to the national level.
w3604|Most developing countries impose controls on international capital flows, coupled with controls on domestic financial intermediaries. These phenomena have been extensively studied in development economics, and are labelled "financial repression". Analyses of the effects of financial repression, like those by McKinnon (1973), Shaw (1973) and Fry (1988), point to the inefficiencies arising from controls on international asset trade and domestic financial intermediaries and set forth clearcut policy prescriptions, which have been followed, under the auspices of international institutions, by a number of countries. These prescriptions envisage a removal of controls on international asset trade, together with the removal of price and quantity rationing in domestic financial intermediation.1 While the theoretical analyses of the effects of controls on financial markets are clearly correct, their direct applications to policy have neglected the presence of important additional distortions in the economy. More satisfactory approaches to financial liberalization should explicitly account for these pre-existing distortions, including the ones associated with government spending and taxes.
w11495|It has long been argued that legislatures in which representatives are elected by geographically defined districts will make inefficient decisions. According to conventional wisdom, legislators will try to benefit their constituents at the expense of the general community through pork barrel spending and other distributive policies (eg, cotton or tobacco subsidies). This leads to both excessive spending and a misallocation of government revenues between distributive policies and important national public goods. Despite this widely held view, formal political theory tells us little about the dynamics of legislative policy choices.
w3159|There are many unresolved issues about the effects of unemployment insurance (UI). Many studies have examined the effects of the level of UI benefits on the length of unemployment spells. However, Welch (1977) and others have criticized these studies, arguing that it is difficult to distinguish effects of UI from effects of previous earnings since the level of benefits is a nonlinear function of previous earnings. In this paper, the natural experiment provided by periodic increases in state benefit levels is used to obtain estimates of the effects of higher UI benefits. While higher UI benefits may increase the length of unemployment spells, they may also lead to higher reemployment earnings. This hypothesis has not been extensively tested.
w12022|It has been well documented that the volatility of output, infliation, interest rates and many other macroeconomic variables of the US economy has exhibited a very high degree of time variation over the last fifty years (see, for instance, Sims and Zha (2004) or Stock and Watson (2003a)). Perhaps, the most notorious episode of substantial volatility shift in recent US economic history is the Great Moderation,1 which corresponds to the sharp decline in the standard deviation of output as well as other macroeconomic and financial variables since the mid 1980s.
w5537|The title of this paper should come as a surprise to most economists. That there exists an empirical association between openness and the scope of government is not well known. In fact, it is far from obvious that there should be any such association at all. Moreover, once informed about this empirical regularity, most economists would guess that the correlation is a negative rather than positive one-that is, they would expect the size of government to be smaller in more open economies. This for two reasons mainly. First, societies which choose to open their economies to international trade are likely to have a predilection in favor of free markets, and hence should also prefer smaller government.
w3210|Output per hour worked in the United States today is ten times as valuable as output per hour worked 100 years ago. (Maddison, 1982). Since the 1950s, economists have attributed much of the change in output per hour worked either directly or indirectly to technological change. (Abromowitz, 1956, Kendrick, 1956, Solow, 1957.) From a naive point of view this seems right. The raw materials that we use have not changed, but as a result of trial and error, experimentation, refinement, and scientific investigation, the instructions that we follow for combining raw materials have become vastly more sophisticated. One hundred years ago, all we could do to get visual stimulation from iron oxide was to use it as pigment. Now we put it on plastic tape and use it to make video cassette recordings. The argument presented in this paper is based on three premises. The first is that technological change-improvement in the instructions for mixing together raw materials-lies at the heart of economic growth.
w1973|Economists have long suspected that a number of industries hold excess capacity or capital stock. Over the 38 years from 1948 through 1985, the Federal Reserve Board's index of capacity utilization in manufacturing has averaged only 82 percent-in the typical year, output has stood 18 percent below the feasible level chosen to represent 100 percent. Only in one year, 1966, did capacity utilization reach as high as 90 percent. The last year in which utilization exceeded 85 percent was 1973. Theorists have contributed two main explanations for chronic excess capacity: First, Chamberlin's (1933) model of monopolistic competition and its refinements such as Spence (1976) and Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) suggest that firms may each retain monopoly power even though entry proceeds to the point of zero expected profit. In the resulting equilibrium, firms operate with declining average cost. Under certain conditions, the equilibrium may involve excess capacity according to a reasonable definition. Second, Spence (1977) and Dixit (1980), with many successors, have shown that the incumbent firm enjoying profit from a monopoly or oligopoly position may choose to hold excess capacity in order to deter entry. The reserve capacity lowers the expected profit of the potential entrant, provided the incumbent's threat to use the capacity after entry is credible. Existing evidence on excess capacity is far from conclusive.
w0570|Although empirical studies measuring the effects of trade unions have multiplied in the last few years, the behavioral underpinnings of unionism remain poorly understood. This is because the issues raised in the literature on trade union goals and wage determination have been mired in fruitless methodological debates or simply have not been pursued at an empirical level. Consequently, although a variety of plausible models of unionism have been proposed, an evaluation of them in terms of their correspondence with observed behavior would rest today on barely more reliable information than was available to Dunlop (1944) when he wrote his seminal work almost forty years ago.
w2046|This paper investigates the nature of annuity markets and the composition of private portfolios when there exists ex ante private information regarding individual specific survival probabilities. The existence of such private information leads to equilibrium annuity contracts which constrain subsets of agents with respect to the quantity of annuities that they can purchase. When the magnitude of agents' investments in some non-annuity type asset is non-observable, these quantity constraints may be sufficiently binding to lead some agents who do not have bequest motives to finance a portion of their old age consunption via bequeathable wealth. This can occur despite the fact that the equilibrium rate of return on bequeathable wealth is lower than the equilibrium rate of return on annuities. Given uncertain lifetimes, the voluntary private accumulation of bequeathable wealth generates involuntary bequests. In contrast to Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), Abel (1985) and Eckstein, Eichenbaum and Peled (1985a), among others, who exclude annuity markets on an a.
w8462|In standard asset pricing theory, expected stock returns are related cross-sectionally to returns' sensitivities to state variables with pervasive effects on consumption and investment opportunities. The basic intuition is that a security whose lowest returns tend to accompany unfavorable shifts in quantities affecting an investor's overall welfare must offer additional compensation to the investor for holding that security. Liquidity appears to be a good candidate for a priced state variable. It is often viewed as important for investment decisions, and recent studies find that fluctuations in various measures of liquidity are correlated across stocks.1 This empirical study investigates whether market-wide liquidity is indeed priced. That is, we ask whether cross-sectional differences in expected stock returns are related to the sensitivities of returns to fluctuations in aggregate liquidity.2 Liquidity is a broad and elusive concept that generally denotes the ability to trade large quantities quickly, at low cost, and without moving the price.
w6285|Why do economies exhibit sustained per capita growth? Almost by definition, a model of long-run growth requires a differential equation that is "linear" in its state variable, such as X = _X. (1) Growth models differ according to the way in which they label the X variable and the story they tell in order to fill in the blank.1 For example, the original Solow model without technological progress does not have linearity because of diminishing returns to capital, so that growth eventually ceases. To generate sustained growth in that model, one adds exogenous technological progress in the form of a differential equation that is assumed to be linear: A = gA. Much of the work in both new and old growth theory can be read as the search for the appropriate characterization of equation (1).
w2148|Between 1978 and 1984 output in the Chinese agricultural sector increased by over 50 percent (Johnson 1985). These impressive output gains followed the adoption of a system stressing individual responsibility in place of a system of communal decision-making and rewards. The ongoing economic reform in China has attracted much attention in the West, in part because it represents a major social experiment in the design of institutions in which a > system emphasizing ideology and social sanctions has been replaced by a system relying more heavily on economic incentives. However, not all the increase in Chinese agricultural output can be attributed to systemic changes, because at the same time, the prices of agricultural outputs and the use of inputs such as chemical fertilizers were increased.^ This paper presents a method for decomposing the productivity increase in Chinese agriculture in the post-1978 period into that part attributable to price increases and that part which reflects the effects of strengthened individual incentives under the new institutional structure. Our method combines standard growth-accounting techniques with a simple model of peasants' rational response to the institution within which they work.
w0319|Economists are paying increasing attention to the study of situations in which consumers face a discrete rather than a continuous set of choices. A considerable literature has grown covering econometric methodology and applications to a wide variety of situations.* In a few specific cases, 2 estimates of discrete choice models have been employed for welfare analysis. Travel demand researchers have developed "composite cost" and "accessibility" measures to evaluate the desirability of various states (Williams [1977], Ben-Akiva and Lerman [1978]), but the relationship of these to conventional welfare criteria has not been thoroughly explored. Indeed, very little has been said in general regarding the validity of the tools of applied welfare economics in discrete choice situations. Nevertheless, in at least two areas in which discrete choice models are applied, welfare judgments are of paramount interest. The first is the analysis of taxes and subsidies. Econometric studies of the impacts of taxes on labor supply, savings, and housing decisions have permitted calculation of the welfare 3 cost or "excess burden" of the tax feature under consideration. Traditionally, such studies have assumed that the taxed activity will be pursued regardless of the existence of the tax.
w0356|In principle, free trade can make everyone better off; but received theory, from Stolper and Samuelson (1941) to Jones (1971), suggests that this is unlikely to happen in practice. The changes in relative goods prices that come with expanded trade produce changes in the distribution of income; and in the simple models which make up the core of trade theory these changes in income distribution invariably leave the owners of some factors of production absolutely worse off. The implication is that trade liberalization always involves trading off gains for some against losses for others, suggesting that moves toward freer trade will occur only rarely and after severe political struggles.
w13409|How is the price level determined, in modern .at-money economies in which the central bank follows an interest rate target, ignoring monetary aggregates? The new-Keynesian, Taylor-Rule approach to monetary economics provides the current 'standard answer' to this, perhaps the most fundamental question of macroeconomics. In this theory, inflation is determined because the Fed systematically raises nominal interest rates more than one-for-one with inflation. This 'active' interest rate target is thought to eliminate the indeterminacy that results from .xed nominal interest rate targets. New-Keynesian models do not say that higher inflation causes the Fed to raise real interest rates, which in turn lowers 'demand' and reduces future inflation.
w5760|The number of countries that have old age or survivor income programs provided through the public sector has increased by almost five times since 1940---from 33 to 155.1 Although the financing of these programs varies widely across countries, the benefits are paid out almost exclusively in terms of annuities and they often cover more than 90 percent of the labor force2. Furthermore, private pensions add to the degree of annuitization of most elderly populations.
w6841|We study a one-sector growth model with convex capital-adjustment costs. The nonstandard feature is that the entire distribution of capital - and not just its average or its maximum - enters the production function "externally". Such external effects should arise among agents that invest in learning, but they also can arise, in a reduced form sense, in situations like patent-races that may not involve external effects among the investors. We get two main results. First, when the incentive to grab rents or to free ride is strong enough, inequality is the only long-run outcome.
w8522|Since Coase's (1937) landmark paper on the theory of the firm, economists have devoted increasing attention to the internal workings of organizations. An important development in this literature is the empirical study of incentive systems within organizations. Using data derived from the internal records of firms, economists have documented how explicit and implicit incentives shape organizational structure and performance.1 Our research contributes to this new empirical literature by studying incentives in a setting that has received relatively little attention from economists, but which has important implications for public policy: physician incentives in managed care organizations.2 Americans spend more than one trillion dollars annually on health care.
w3980|Following the First World War, British unemployment rose to unprecedented levels that persisted throughout the interwar period. Unemployment averaged 10.6 percent between 1921 and 1938, more than double the average during the five decades preceding the First World War, and five times that in the two decades following the Second World War. The prolonged episode of high unemployment in the interwar period was unusual in several respects: it was accompanied by extensive shifts of output between sectors and regions and by moderate growth in both industrial production and GNP, and it diverged markedly from contemporaneous patterns of unemployment in other industrial economies. Not surprisingly, this episode of high unemployment has provided fertile ground for competing theories of unemployment. The primary contenders in this debate, as in the debates over recent unemployment, are adverse aggregate fluctuations, increased search activity, and sectoral reallocation shocks. Those who emphasize aggregate fluctuations argue that firms across a broad cross-section of sectors laid off workers in response to economy-wide adverse demand shocks associated with monetary contraction. The proponents of the search hypothesis contend that an increase in unemployment benefits enabled workers to be more selective in their job searches, leading to a sharp increase in search activity on aggregate.
w5654|The aim of this paper is to provide an upper bound estimate of the rate of convergence to purchasing power parity (PPP). The speed at which relative prices move toward parity is important for theories of exchange rate determination and for open-economy macro models, almost all of which employ versions of PPP. Professional wisdom regarding the rate of convergence toward PPP has run the full gamut - from fairly high, to nearly zero, and now, back to positive but slow. In markets for goods and services there is little expectation that price disparities will instantly disappear as they do, for example, in financial markets, due to both explicit and implicit barriers to the flows of goods and services. We examine convergence in a context where many of these barriers are absent in order to quantitatively assess their importance in markets less integrated. Not long after Jacob Frenkel's seminal work (1978) which provided evidence supportive of convergence to PPP during a hyperinflation, many subsequent studies concluded a "collapse of purchasing power parities."1 In particular, these studies failed to reject the hypothesis that real exchange rates follow a random walk, which implies that any deviation from PPP is permanent.
w2630|In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the analysis of smuggling as an economic phenomenon.1 The seminal paper in this area is by Bhagwati and Hansen [1973], who examined the welfare effects of smuggling under perfect competition and monopoly in a two good trade model. They found that smuggling would necessarily reduce welfare only when smuggling coexisted with legal trade. This spawned a series of articles which, to a large extent, dealt with when the coexistence of legal trade and smuggling could be welfare increasing. By introducing a third non-traded good, Sheikh [1974] showed that smuggling which coexisted with legal trade could be welfare improving.
w7388|The purpose of this paper is to develop a model of hierarchies based on the allocation of authority. We take the view that a firm's owners have ultimate authority over a firm's decisions, but that they have limited time or capacity to exercise this authority. Hence the owners must delegate some authority to subordinates, ie, they must grant the subordinates the right to make decisions that they themselves are unable or unwilling to make. However, these subordinates also have limited time or capacity to exercise authority and so further delegation must occur to other subordinates. Thus we view a firm as a chain of command over decisions.
w6482|Recent advances in information technology (IT) have led many firms to consider adopting "process monitoring" applications which give middle managers access to timely information about production. These can help managers make better short-run decisions concerning the allocation of their firms' resources and improve how they motivate workers.1 Some middle managers in manufacturing now can monitor work at one or more production lines remotely and view up-to-the-minute inventory levels. Managers at package shipping companies such as Federal Express can view local demand conditions and resource utilization.2 Process monitoring can even extend to intellectual output. Managers of research and development projects can monitor their teams' progress by using "groupware" applications such as Lotus Notes.
w2776|Much of the current theory of asset pricing is based on the consumer's first order conditions, 1 - P Et Â» , ^ t+1 -ff ^ u'(ct) (1) where Rt+1 is che return on an asset and p is the consumer's discount factor. This equation can be derived from the statement that the consumer's marginal rate of substitution between date and state contingent claims should be equal to the price ratio of such claims. This paper explores the equivalent equation for pre .ucers, which can be derived from the condition that the marginal rate of transformation between date and state contingent claims should also equal their price ratio. Its purpose is to provide an empirically tractable framework for linking asset returns to macroeconomic fluctuations. There is a great deal of evidence that such links exist: term premia in the bond market, futures premia in the foreign exchange market, and risk premia in the stock market vary through time and are correlated with macroeconomic variables. (See, among others, Hansen and Hodrick (1983), Fama and Bliss (1987), Chen, Roll and Ross (1986), and Ferson (1986)). The most common approach to explaining these results uses (1) to link asset price phenomena to consumption data or state variables presumed to determine consumption, but this approach has not been particularly successful to date. As a result, a great deal of work on the specification of the consumption based model is in progress, including durability, continuous time, a variety of consumption goods, new forms for the utility function (state nonseparability, habit persistence), lack of perfect consumption insurance, heterogeneous consumers, borrowing constraints, money, etc.
w7122|The age at which successful practitioners typically do their best work is known to vary across professions. Studies by psychologists have shown that mathematicians, physicists, and poets typically make their most important contributions at younger ages than do astronomers, biologists, and novelists.1 Psychologists consider these differences to be a function of the rates at which creative ideations can be produced and elaborated: they believe that both of these processes are more rapid in disciplines that deal with abstract conceptual entities than in those whose central ideas are more complex and concrete.2 The psychologists' empirical studies have been based on the assumption that the typical peak age for creativity in a profession is invariant over time, or changes only gradually.3 Yet economists have pointed to a variety of factors that can potentially produce rapid changes in the relationship between age and productivity in a given activity.4 This paper presents a case study of a profession in which a change in the criteria for quality produced a dramatic change in the age at which successful practitioners executed their best work. The profession considered here is modern American painting.
w3792|This paper studies career concerns---concerns about the effects of current performance on future compensation---and describes how optimal incentive contracts are affected when career concerns must be taken into account. Career concerns arise frequently: they occur whenever the (internal or external) labor market uses a worker's current output to update its belief about the worker's ability and then bases future wages on these updated beliefs. In such a setting, the worker will want to take actions the market cannot observe, in an attempt to increase output and thus influence the market's belief; in equilibrium, however, the market will anticipate these actions and so draw the correct inference about ability from the observed output. Career concerns are stronger when a worker is further from retirement, because a longer prospective career increases the return to changing the market's belief.
w10231|Interest in the determinants of the equilibrium path for population has in- creased recently. (See Becker and Barro (1988), Barro and Becker (1989), Raut (1990), Doepke (2001), Fernandez-Villaverde (2001), Boldrin and Jones (2002), and Tertilt (2004). See Nerlove and Raut (1997) for a survey.) Sur- prisingly, little of this literature has used the tools of modern welfare eco- nomics (for example, Debreu (1962)) to address the normative questions that arise. This is because, at least in part, the usual notion of Pareto-efficiency is not well defined for environments in which the population is endogenous. To illustrate this, consider the following example. Compare an allocation with two agents, each consuming one unit of a lone consumption good, with an allocation where only one agent is born, but consumes two units of the consumption good. Is one allocation Pareto-superior to the other? Pareto- efficiency would involve a comparison, for each person, of the two alloca- tions.
w10259|This paper is motivated by two stylized facts. First, the vast majority of professionally-managed investment vehicles (ie, mutual funds, hedge funds) are structured on an open-end, as opposed to closed-end basis, making it possible for their clients to liquidate shares on demand.1 Second, both theory and evidence suggest that the open-end form imposes serious constraints on would-be arbitrageurs. In particular, being open-end exposes arbitrageurs to the risk of large withdrawals if they perform poorly in the short run.2 This risk in turn makes it dangerous for them to put on trades that are attractive in a long-run sense, but where convergence to fundamentals is unlikely to be either smooth or rapid—a point that has been made by Shleifer and Vishny (1997).
w0288|In this paper we develop a model of the demand for money which Incorporates transactions and precautionary motives. The analytical framework is based on the principles of inventory management which have been applied by Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956) to study the transactions demand for money. The key feature of our model is its stochastic characteristics which lead to the need for precautionary reserves. We analyze the determinants of optimal money holdings when net disbursements are governed by a stochastic process. In this context we adopt some aspect of the analytical framework that has been developed by Miller and Orr (1966). Section II contains the analytical framework of the model and the formal derivation of optimal money holdings. In this context we analyze the determinants of the various elasticities of the demand for money.
w2112|There has been much recent discussion about the ultimate sources of macroeconomic variability. Shiller (1987) surveys this work, where he points out that a number of authors attribute most of output or unemployment variability to only a few sources, sometimes only one. The sources vary from technology shocks for Kydland and Prescott (1982), to unanticipated changes in the money stock for Barro (1977), to "unusual structural shifts," such as changes in the demand for produced goods relative to services, for Lilien (1982), to oil price shocks for Hamiltion (1983), to changes in desired consumption for Hall (1986). (See Shiller (1987) for more references.) Although it may be that there are only a few important sources of macroeconomic variability, this is far from obvious. Economies seem complicated, and it may be that there are many important sources.
w0502|The fluctuations of the marginal efficiency of capital, and the attendant high variat ion in the aggregate demand for investment goods, are still an important feature of business cycles. Our understanding of these fluctuations, however, has not substantially advanced since Keynes' day. The earlier accelerator models1 of investment exhibited the right cyclical properties, but their decision-theoretic bases were weak. More recent literature on investment demand has stressed longrun considerations' Investment is predicted to occur when expected 2 returns over the life of the project exceed its costs. This later work explain average investment over the longer term, but it does not do much to help us understand the sometimes radical swings in investment spending that can occur in a relatively short period. This paper presents a theory of investment in which optimizing behavior and short-run investment fluctuations are compatible. Central to the theory is an analysis of how newly-arriving information - Keynes' "shifting and unreliable evidence" - affects the investment decision.
w1618|In this paper we analyze an aggregative general equilibrium model in which the use of money is motivated by a Clower [1967]-type cash-in-advance constraint, applied to purchases of a subset of consumption goods. This system is subject to both real and monetary shocks, which are economy-wide and observed by all. The model is designed to study how the behavior of equilibrium quantities and prices (including interest rates) depends upon the stochastic processes generating the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of real output. One way to think of the paper is as a contribution to the theory of interest. The model captures the real and nominal determinants of interest rates in a way that reproduces the familiar Fisherian formulas in deterministic contexts, and also shows how these formulas need to be modified in a wide class of stochastic environments. This motivation is shared with Lucas [1982] and Svensson [1983], but in those two papers the equilibrium resource allocations were determined entirely by the exogenously given goods endowments, so that the analysis involved determining the behavior of prices given quantities.
w2591|2 The phenomenon of procyclical physical productivity in the face of wars and other demand shocks has long been recognized. Businessmen have always appreciated the benefits of cyclical expansion; they are able to use their capacity more fully and so their costs per-unit fall. Countless empirical studies have demonstrated that increases in labor input over the business cycle are associated with more than proportional increases in output.1 The appropriate interpretation of the procyclicality of various productivity measures has long been a matter of debate among economists and has attracted renewed interest since the work of Hall (1987, 1988). This paper seeks to rehabilitate both theoretically and empirically an idea that has gone somewhat out of fashion---the notion that procyclical productivity regardless of how measured arises because it is costly for firms to adjust their capacity and so capacity utilization (both in terms of labor and capital) fluctuates over the business cycle.
w6686|We develop a general equilibrium model of search and matching with risk-averse agents and incomplete insurance. Firms make irreversible investments and post wages. Workers optimally search among posted wages. There is an unavoidable risk for workers in this frictional economy as they may suffer unemployment. When workers are more risk-averse, wages and unemployment decrease, and firms invest less. The reason is that risk-averse workers wish to avoid the risk of unemployment, and in response, the labor market offers its own version of insurance, an equilibrium with higher employment but lower wages. In a frictional market, when the unemployment risk of workers is reduced, the vacancy risk of firms increases, implying lower utilization of their ex ante investment. Anticipating this, firms reduce their capital-labor ratio. UI encourages workers to apply to high wage jobs with high unemployment risk. The impact of UI on worker and firm behavior is driven by a form of moral hazard.
w11071|The composition of sovereign debt and how it affects debt restructuring nego- tiations in the event of financial distress, has become a central policy issue in recent years. There are two major reasons why the spotlight has been turned on this question. First, the change in the IMF’s policy orientation towards sovereign debt crises, with a proposed greater weight on ‘private sector involve- ment’ (Rey Report, G-10, 1996), has brought up the question of how easy it actually is to get ‘the private sector involved’; that is, how easy it is to get private debt-holders to agree to a debt restructuring.
w8004|Since 1991, the United States has experienced the sharpest drop in murder rates since the end of Prohibition in 1933. Homicide rates have fallen more than 40 percent. Violent crime and property crime have each declined more than 30 percent. Hundreds of articles discussing this change have appeared in the academic literature and popular press.1 They have offered an array of explanations: the increasing use of incarceration, growth in the number of police, improved policing strategies such as those adopted in New York, declines in the crack cocaine trade, the strong economy, and increased expenditures on victim precautions such as security guards and alarms. None of these factors, however, can provide an entirely satisfactory explanation for the large, widespread, and persistent drop in crime in the 1990's.
w3734|In recent years there has been a surge in the application of formal microeconomic models of discontinuous and lumpy adjustment ---originally developed in the early 50's for retail inventories--- to a variety of topics in economics, such as cash balances, labor demand, investment, entry and exit, prices, durable goods and technology upgrade. Yet the possibility of explaining aggregate economic phenomena based on these models has remained largely unexplored, primarily because of the technical difficulties involved. Since aggregate data do not look as discontinuous and lumpy as their microeconomic counterparts, in order to apply these models to macroeconomic data aggregation has to be modeled explicitly. This is hard to do when shocks are not purely idiosyncratic but also have a common (or, equivalent^, aggregate) component. The few results existent in the literature have provided important insights, but have been limited either to numerical simulations (Blinder 1981) or to steady state analysis (Caplin 1985, Caplin and Spulber 1987).
w13661|Becker's (1957) seminal 'The Economics of Discrimination' launched the formal analysis of labor market discrimination among economists. Becker's analysis focused on the relationship between racial prejudice among whites and discrimination against racial minorities in a competitive model. In contrast to much of the contemporaneous literature, Becker formalized the definition of racial preferences, depicting them as an aversion to cross-racial interaction. In a series of models, he analyzed the effect of the possession of such preferences among customers, co-workers and employers on black relative wages. Since the publication of Becker's work, discrimination has been one of the most intensely studied topics in economics; theorists have posited different explanations for racial wage gaps including many which do not depend on racial animus, and there have been hundreds of empirical studies devoted to measuring and attempting to explain wage differences. Yet, curiously, in the massive and growing discrimination literature, there is no paper of which we are aware that tests the sharp, yet subtle predictions of Becker's original prejudice model about the relationship between racial wage gaps and prejudice. In this paper, we attempt to address this omission. In the short-run version of Becker's employer discrimination model, racial prejudice causes some employers to regard black workers as more expensive than they truly are. Market pressures cause blacks to be hired by the least prejudiced employers in the market and to sort away from those with the highest levels of prejudice. In equilibrium, Becker shows that black relative wages are determined by the most prejudiced employer with whom they come into contact---the marginal discriminator. Racial wage gaps, in Becker's formulation, are determined by the prejudice of this marginal person, and not by the average level of prejudice among all employers. More generally, given the sorting mechanism described above, and since blacks constitute a relatively small share of the labor force in almost every labor market, wage gaps will generally be determined by variation in the level of prejudice of those in the lower tail of the prejudice distribution; how prejudiced the most prejudiced employers are should not matter at all for wages in Becker's framework.
w12924|For every dollar of revenue raised by the US income tax system, taxpayers incur about 10 cents in private compliance costs associated with record keeping and tax filing (Slemrod 1996). These compliance costs impose a dead-weight burden on society. Yet policies that would reduce these costs are frequently opposed by policy-makers and economists who believe that compliance costs play an important role in keeping taxes visible and salient to the electorate, who then serve as an important check on attempts to raise the scale of government activity beyond what an informed citizenry would want. For example, Milton Friedman has publicly lamented his inadvertent contribution to the growth of government by encouraging the introduction of the visibility-reducing Federal income tax withholding system during the Second World War (Friedman and Friedman, 1998 p.123).
w3503|Since its discovery by Hultgren (1960), the procyclical behavior of average labor productivity, also known as short run increasing returns to labor (SRIRL), has achieved the status of a basic stylized fact of macroeconomics. The ubiquitous nature of procyclical productivity has been confirmed by studies at levels of aggregation ranging from the firm to the national economy, and for a variety of countries and sample periods. Much of the original research on procyclical productivity was undertaken during the 1960s and early 1970s, contributions being made by Ball and St. Cyr <1966), Brechling (1965), Kuh (1965), Solow (1968), Fair (1969), and Sims (1974), among others. More recently, attention has been refocused on SRIRL in the context of research on real business cycles (Prescott (1986a)), and by papers by Fay and Medoff (1985), Hall (1987, 1988a, 1988b), Rotemberg and Summers (1988), and Chirinko (1989).
w2572|Most models of factor adjustment assume smooth paths from an Initial to a final equilibrium when the fundamental determinants of factor demand are shocked. Indeed, most recent econometric work has even assumed that the adjustment is characterized by a geometric lag structure. The purposes of this study are to reexamine the theory underlying these assumptions, to discover whether they make sense empirically, and to consider the implications of alternative estimates that allow one to infer the structure of the costs of adjusting labor demand. This reexamination is necessary for several reasons. It may be that predictions of the paths of factor demand are unaffected by econometric specifications that fail to embody the underlying structure of the adjustment costs that face decision-makers at the firm level. However, without specifying and estimating equations that embody these structures we cannot know if this is so.
w19369|The United States experienced a dramatic increase in educational attainment during the 20th century. While less than 25 percent of Americans born in 1930 attended college, over 60 percent of those born in 1970 did so (Goldin and Katz 2008). These gains were precipitated by the rapid expansion of secondary education, known as the "High School Movement," which resulted in the high school graduation rate rising from 9 percent in 1910 to 51 percent in 1940 (Goldin 1998). Numerous factors contributed to the spread of high schools in the first part of the century including competition among localities to increase property values and a rising demand for educated workers (Goldin and Katz 2008).
w1916|Robert Lucas begins his classic article "Understanding Business Cycles" with the question, "Why is it that, in capitalist economies, aggregate variables undergo repeated fluctuations about trend, all of essentially the same character?" Many textbooks introduce macroeconomics with a graph of real GNP together with a trend line, implying that the purpose of macroeconomic theory is to explain the deviations of production from the trend. Implicit both in Lucas's question and in a such a picture is the notion that output fluctuations are transitory. Certainly this view is implicit in the standard explanation of the business cycle: the natural rate of output grows at a more or less constant rate while output fluctuations represent temporary deviations from this natural rate. The purpose of this paper is to question this conventional view. In particular, we examine one simple implication for the univariate properties of economic t-ime series. If fluctuations in output are dominated by temporary deviations from the natural rate, then an innovation in output should not substantially change one's forecast of output in, say, ten or twenty years.
w9009|On news of a takeover, the share price of the target firm usually rises sharply, while that of the acquiring firm usually falls. The joint value may or may not rise. Surveying the field, Andrade, Mitchell and Stafford (2001) report that since 1973 target premia were 20 or 30 percent, acquirer discounts were minus 3 or 4 percent, and that the joint value shows no clear pattern. They conclude (p. 118) that "the fact that mergers do not seem to benefit acquirers provides a reason to worry [ ] that mergers do not raise value]." To explain such evidence (Shleifer and Vishny 2001) have assumed that investors are irrational and (Roll 1986) has assumed that managers use takeovers to extend their empires at the expense of the shareholder.
w3399|Within national boundaries, laws and contracts allow parties to influence each other's actions. A third party, the legal system, can punish chose ÃÂ«ho break lavs or breach contracts. Ill contract, the interactions of sovereign governments, or of parties under the Jurisdictions of .different sovereign governments, typically lack third parties to enforce contracts and agreements. Hence, parties to such contracts or agreements must themselves be willing to enforce them if they are to have any effect. Enforcement may then require measures that affect the other party directly, without involving anyone else. Economic sanctions, steps by a government that Inflict harm on another country, possibly at a cost to Itself, are such measures. National governments have often, used economic sanctions to affect policies of other countries.1 The United States government, for example, has banned trade with Cuba and South Africa In response to policies- of their governments. US trade law calls for trade restrictions against countries found to engage In practices that damage US Industry or infringe upon US intellectual property. Finally, collecting repayment from debtor governments may require that creditor countries threaten Co curtail financial relations or trade with debtor countries.
w2809|What role do the external trading environment and commercial policy play in the determination of long-run economic performance? This central question of International economics has received surprisingly little attention In the theoretical literature over the years. Previous research on trade and growth has adopted the neoclassical framework to focus on factor accumulation in the open economy. (See the surveys by Findlay (1984) and Smith (1984)). This research largely neglects the effects of trade structure on rates of growth, however, addressing Instead the reverse causation from growth and accumulation to trade patterns.^ The direction that the research followed almost surely can be ascribed to the well-known property of the standard neoclassical growth model with diminishing returns to capital that (endogenous) growth in per capita Income dissipates In the long run. For this reason, the familiar models which Incorporate investment only in capital equipment seem ill-suited for analysis of long-run growth. The available evidence collected since the seminal work of Solow (1957) also leads one to look beyond capital accumulation for an explanation of growth.
w12433|The underlying structure of most dynamic business-cycle and consumption-based asset-pricing models is a variant of the neoclassical stochastic growth model. Such models have been analyzed by, among others, Cass (1965), Brock and Mirman (1972), and Donaldson and Mehra (1983). They focus on how an omniscient central planner seeking to maximize the present value of expected utility of a representative agent, optimally allocates resources over the infinite time horizon. Production is limited by an aggregate production function subject to technological (total factor productivity) shocks. The solution to the planning problem is characterized by time-invariant decision rules, which determine optimal consumption and investment each period. These decision rules have as arguments the economy's period aggregate capital stock and the shock to technology. Business cycles, however, are not predicated on the actions of a central planner, but arise from interactions among economic agents in competitive markets. Given the desirable features of the stochastic growth paradigm--the solution methods are well known and the model generates well-defined proxies for all the major macro aggregates: consumption, investment, output, etc.--it is natural to ask if the allocations arising in that model can be viewed as competitive equilibria. That is, do price sequences exist such that economic agents, optimizing at these prices and interacting through competitive markets, achieve the allocations in question as competitive equilibria? This is the essential question of dynamic-decentralization theory.
w10991|In coming years, the AIDS epidemic will visit upon the peoples of southern Africa a plague of immeasurable horror. The growth of HIV infection amongst African adults during the 1990s far exceeded most forecasts, with infection rates amongst pregnant women in, for exam- ple, South Africa reaching 25 percent by the year 2000 (Figure 1.1). While adults with HIV typi- cally remain asymptomatic for 8 or 9 years, they develop AIDS soon thereafter and quickly succumb to the torturous infections and cancers which overwhelm their degraded immune systems. Thus, existing infection rates, in and of themselves, presage the imminent death of at least five million young South African adults aged 15-49 in the coming decade, without consid- eration of the millions among future cohorts who will be infected at birth or as young adults.
w5345|Derivative securities are contingent claims whose payoffs depend upon another asset's payoff. Stock options, futures, swaps, caps, floors, bonds, callable bonds, convertibles, bond options, all fall into this category. Derivative securities are widely traded both over the counter and on exchanges, and more often than not the volume traded is much larger for the derivative securities than the underlying assets that sustain them. The theory of derivative security pricing relies essentially on continuous-time arbitrage arguments since the pioneering Black and Scholes (1973) paper. As further demonstrated by the work of Merton (eg
w5606|It seems undeniable that the increase in the skill premium in the advanced world is primarily the result of skill-biased technological change. Paul Krugman, a Stanford University economist (1994) I don't think a guy will be able to go into his country club if he doesn't have a CADffCAM ficomputer aided manufacturing and design system] system in his factory. He's got to be able to talk about his CADffCAM system as he tees off on the third tee - or he will be embarrassed. Joseph Engelberger, founder of Unimation, the first major US robot manufacturer (Schlesinger 1983) There has been a large widening of wage differentials in the US and other industrialized countries during the past 15 years. Many researchers have attributed this change to skill-biased technological change (see Bound and Johnson (1992)). The evidence supporting a major role for skill-biased technical change, however, is primarily inferential. Wages for highly skilled workers in the US have risen while the number of skilled workers has risen as well. In the view of many, therefore, this requires an explanation based on an increased demand for more skilled labor.
w4397|One of the striking economic events of the 1980s was the sudden appearance, in the early part of the decade, of a large volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States. This development raised a number of important conceptual and policy questions, all of them linked, ultimately, to the source of the FDI surge. One explanation frequently offered is that the 1981 US tax change greatly encouraged foreigners to invest in America. If it is true that tax changes are partly responsible for the FDI inflow, then the US tax reforms currently under consideration in Congress (and elsewhere) are likely to carry important implications for future patterns of FDI. Unfortunately, rather little is known about the magnitude of the effect of taxation on foreign direct investment. This paper examines the effect of state tax rates in the US on the location of foreign direct investment within the US. Foreign investors in the United States pay state taxes on their investment income at (roughly) the same rates that US investors pay on theirs.
w4376|When do shareholders benefit from firm diversification? Coase's answer is that the boundary of the firm should be at the point where "the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction by means of an exchange in the open market or the costs of organizing in another firm" (Coase (1937)). As pointed out by Williamson (1981) and others, this answer requires an operational definition of transaction costs. Depending on one's view of transaction costs, one can look at a firm and find it either efficiently organized or not.
w17347|I propose a flexible framework for the quantitative analysis of unilateral and multilateral trade policy. It is based on a multi-country multi-industry general equilibrium model of international trade featuring inter-industry trade as in Ricardo (1817), intra-industry trade as in Krugman (1980), and special interest politics as in Grossman and Helpman (1994). By combining these elements, it takes a unified view of trade policy which nests traditional, new trade, and political economy motives for protection. Specifically, it features import tariffs which serve to manipulate the terms-of-trade, shift profits away from other countries, and channel profits towards politically influential industries. I use this framework to address some natural questions emerging from the qualitative trade policy literature. To this end, I calibrate it to perfectly match industry-level trade and tariffs of the main players in recent GATTffWTO negotiations.
w4634|Will continued economic growth throughout the world bring ever greater harm to the earth's environment? Or do increases in income and wealth sew the seeds for the amelioration of ecological problems? The answers to these questions are critical for the design of appropriate development strategies for lesser developed countries. Exhaustible and renewable natural resources serve as inputs into the production of many goods and services. If the composition of output and the methods of production were immutable, then damage to the environment would be linked unavoidably to the scale of global economic activity. But substantial evidence suggests that development gives rise to a structural transformation in what an economy produces (see Syrquin, 1989).
w4100|On January 31, 1935 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Amendment 5 to the Code of Fair Competition for the Automobile Manufacturing Industry. Section 3 of the amendment contained the following provision: "The members of the Industry are requested and authorized to enter into agreements with one another with respect to Fall announcements of new models of passenger automobiles and the holding of automobile shows in the Fall of the year, as a means of facilitating regularization of employment in the industry." Relative to current standards, this level of government intervention seems quite extraordinary. In fact, this amendment was part of the President's program, under the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), to regularize employment in the economy. Implementation of this program involved the negotiation of over 500 quite specific codes of competition regulating conditions of employment and compensation.
w3528|Many economists believe that increased economic integration between the developed economies of the world has tended to increase the long-run rate of economic growth. If they were asked to make an intuitive prediction, they would suggest that prospects for growth would be permanently diminished if a barrier were erected that impeded the flow of all goods, ideas, and people between Asia, Europe, and North America. Yet it would be difficult for any of us to offer a rigorous model that has been (or even could be) calibrated to data and that could justify this belief. We know what some of the basic elements of such a growth model would be. Historical analysis (eg Rosenberg [1980]) shows that the creation and transmission of ideas have been extremely important in the development of modem standards of living. Theoretical arguments dating from Adam Smith's analysis of the pin factory have emphasized the potential importance of fixed costs and the extent of the market. There is a long tradition in trade theory of using models with Marshallian external effects to approach questions about increasing returns.
w3541|This paper takes Robert Solov seriously. In his classic 1956 article, Solov proposed that we begin the study of economic growth by assuming a standard neoclassical production function with decreasing returns to capital. Taking the rates of saving and population growth as exogenous, he showed that these two variables determine the steady-state level of Income per capita. Because saving and population growth rates vary across countries, different countries reach different steady states. Solow's model gives simple testable predictions about how these variables Influence the steady-state level of income. The higher the rate of saving, the richer the country. The higher the rate of population growth, the poorer the country. This paper argues that the predictions of the Solow model are, to a first approximation, consistent with the evidence. Examining recently available data for a large set of countries, we find that saving and population growth affect income in the direction that Solow predicted.
w16541|How do firms make decisions regarding irreversible investments in uncertain economic environments? Such situations are common in a variety of industries: American Electric Power must commence construction of new plants before knowing future demand for electricity, Boeing must sink costs into new airplane designs before orders from customers are realized, and ExxonMobil must drill wells in the midst of a fluctuating price of oil. Each of these investments is at least partially irreversible because the assets created cannot be fully appropriated to an alternative use. In other words, these investments, once complete, become sunk costs.
w13410|The new-Keynesian Taylor-rule approach to monetary economics provides the current standard model of inflation determination, for modern .at-money economies in which the central bank follows an interest rate target, ignoring monetary aggregates. Any good theory relies on a stylized interpretation of important historical episodes. Keynes had the General Theory of the great depression. Friedman and Schwartz had the Monetary History of the US and UK. The central story for the new-Keynesian Taylor rule is that U. S. inflation was stabilized in the early 1980s, by a change from a 'passive' policy in which interest rates did not respond suffciently to inflation, to an 'active' policy in which they did so. Most famously, Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000) run regressions of interest rates on inflation and output. They find inflation coeffcients below one up to 1980, and above one since then. I argue against this central interpretation of the historical record. To see the key point, we need to understand how new-Keynesian models work. They do not say that higher in.
w4065|The corporate governance system in Japan is generally believed to differ significantly from its US counterpart. The Japanese system is usually characterized as bank and relationship oriented; the US system as (stock) market oriented.1 The perceived differences in governance systems are usually associated with different firm objectives in the two countries. There is some disagreement, however, about these objectives. According to some observers, Japanese firms maximize growth or market share, rather than (short-term) profits or share price. For example, in a widely cited section, Abegglen and Stalk (1985) discuss the results of a survey in which Japanese managers rated market share the most important and stock price the least important of nine corporate objectives; US managers rated stock price second.2 Partially based on this type of evidence, Blinder (1991 and 1992) argues that Japanese managers maximize growth not profits; managers are able to pursue such a strategy because Japanese shareholders are unable to effectively discipline them. And Milgrom and Roberts (1992) conclude that "Japanese firms are not run in the interests of their shareholders." In contrast, others view the Japanese governance system as one that does maximize firm value.
w19129|There are two complementary approaches in the literature to capturing the interaction between banking distress and the real economy. The first, summarized recently in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011), emphasizes how the depletion of bank capital in an economic downturn hinders banks ability to intermediate funds. Due to agency problems (and possibly also regulatory constraints) a bank's ability to raise funds depends on its capital. Portfolios losses experienced in a downturn accordingly lead to losses of bank capital that are increasing in the degree of leverage.
w2942|The past decade has witnessed the emergence of an enormous literature that examines the various economic roles of intergenerational transfers. Unfortunately, empirical analysis of gifts and bequests has proven problematic, and several critical questions remain unanswered. Economists disagree sharply about the quantitative importance of intergenerational transfers in the US. By some estimates, these transfers are responsible for approximately four-fifths of aggregate capital accumulation (see Kotlikoff and Summers [1981] and Kotlikoff [1988]); others place this figure below one-fourth (see Modigliani [1988]). There are also several competing schools of thought concerning transfer motives. Some argue that bequests are accidental, and result from precautionary responses to the absence of perfect insurance markets (Hurd [1987]). Others argue that bequests are intentional, and either reflect altruism (Tomes [1981]), or self-interested exchange with one's heirs (Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers [1985]). This paper presents new empirical evidence in support of the view that a significant fraction of total saving is motivated solely by the desire to leave bequests. This evidence is based upon the premise that bequest motives fundamentally alter attitudes towards insurance.
w4554|Much recent research has described the cross-sectional and time-series behavior of asset returns. Asset pricing models with multiple observable or unobservable factors appear to summarize the cross-sectional pattern of returns on common stocks, including some phenomena which are anomalies for the single-factor Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In the time-series, several variables have emerged as reliable forecasters of returns on stocks and other long-term assets. Fama (1991) provides a comprehensive recent survey of this work.' Fama's survey emphasizes the extent to which cross-sectional research has proceeded independently of time-series research. Yet the time-series behavior of returns can provide vital additional evidence needed to interpret and validate cross-sectioned models. As Fama puts it, existing multi-factor models "leave one hungry for economic insights about how the factors relate to uncertainties about consumption and portfolio opportunities that are of concern to investors, that is, the hedging arguments for mul-tifactor models of Fama (1970) and Merton (1973)" (Fama 1991 p. 1594).
w5605|A large portion of human capital accumulation in the form of training and on-the-job learning takes place inside firms. Becker (1965) and Mincer (1972) provide a systematic explanation of training investments and the associated wages of workers. This standard theory draws a crucial distinction between general and firm-specific training. General training will increase workers' wages in a range of employment opportunities, thus it is the worker who has to pay for general training. The firm should only pay for the firm-specific component of training which does not help the worker receive higher wages elsewhere. However, these predictions seem to be at odds with reality. In Germany, firms voluntarily offer apprenticeships to workers entering the labor market. Although general skills are an important component of these programs, much of the financial burden is borne by the firm (see Noll et al., 1983). The same is true in Japan where training and mentoring within companies is more important in many areas than formal schooling (eg there are no business schools in Japan).
w2420|The Stolper-Samuelson derivatives hold a central place in the theory of international trade. These parameters, measuring the sensitivity of domestic factor prices to changes in the output prices of internationally traded goods, reveal the distributional implications of terms of trade changes, and suggest the political economic motivations for trade and industrial policies.
w9175|A patent pool is an agreement among patent owners to license a set of their patents to one another or to third parties. Patent pools have played an important role in industry since the 1856 sewing machine pool, although their number and importance considerably subsided in a hostile antitrust environment after World War II. Patent pools have been making a comeback in the last few years, and many believe that pools are bound to be as important or more important in the new economy as in traditional sectors. Innovations in hardware, software or biotechnology often build on a number of other innovations owned by a diverse set of owners.
w2451|A principal weakness of the theory of optimal taxation with heterogeneous taxpayers is the dependence of the optimum tax rates on the exact properties of the social welfare function. While other components of the problem, such as the excess burden of the tax system, can presumably be recovered from empirical observations on the behavior of consumers, it is clear that estimating the social welfare function is not an easy task. Although there have been several attempts to recover the social welfare function using the revealed preferences of governments, (usually by assuming that governments are acting optimally according to a "just" principal of taxation, such as equal sacrifice), all of these methods require very strong assumptions which are unlikely to command wide support. This problem is especially disturbing for developing countries which rely heavily on commodity taxes as a major policy instrument for raising revenue and changing the income distribution. In most of these countries data is not available even for estimating the excess burden of the tax system. Therefore, it seems that the theory of optimal commodity taxation is not very helpful as an input into policy formulation in this context. This problem is even more complicated from the perspective of an economic adviser whose role is to advise the government of a specific country. If, in an ideal case, the government can supply him with all the necessary data, then the "cost" or the 1.

When the difference between real and nominal quantities is small and stakes are relatively low, equating the nominal dollar amounts with real values provides a convenient and effective rule of thumb. Therefore, it seems plausible that people often ignore the rate of inﬂation in processing information for relatively small decisions.1 Modigliani and Cohn [1979] hypothesize that stock-market investors may also suf- fer from a particular form of money illusion, incorrectly discounting real cash ﬂows with nominal discount rates.
w6758|Recent events in Southeast Asia have renewed interest in the causes and consequences of speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate regimes. The explanation preferred by policy makers in Southeast Asia is that the currency crisis was a self fulfilling prophecy: it happened because speculators thought it was going to happen.1 Not surprisingly, proponents of this view argue that the International Monetary Fund should provide resources to fend off such predatory attacks and help prey countries recover from them. Multiple equilibrium models of currency crises can be used to rationalize this interpretation of recent events in Southeast Asia.
w16274|The February 2011 issue of the American Economic Review (AER) will mark the journal's centennial. As the flagship publication of the American Economic Association (AEA) and one of the leading economics journals worldwide it is appropriate to mark this special anniversary by pausing to take stock. The AER is a mirror of the AEA, so taking stock allows us to see where the AEA has been and may go in the future. My main goal is to outline certain features of the history of the AER. I do so in straightforward factual terms but my description has an analytic core.
w4090|Microeconomic units do not adjust continuously to the shocks they perceive, and when they do, adjustments are often large. For example, consumers do not upgrade their cars after every innovation in their wealth, and firms do not adjust their factors of production and prices every time demand conditions and productivity change. It is well known by now that such a behavior is inconsistent with the (microeconomic) justification for the standard convex adjustment cost model. This led to the application of (S,s) type models --- typically justified by the presence of a non-convexity in the adjustment cost function --- to a wide variety of economic problems wanting for more realistic microfoundations (see, eg
w1669|The most prevalent explanation of fluctuations in the yield curve is the expectations theory, which posits that the slope of the yield curve reflects the Market expectation of the future change in interest rates. Numerous studies, however, present evidence that the data are inconsistent with the joint hypothesis of the expectations theory and rational expectations.1 Indeed, the rejections of the expectations theory date back at least to Macaulay [1938, p. 33], who pointed out the implications of the theory but concluded that "experience is more nearly the opposite." Perhaps the most striking rejections use data at only the short end of the maturity spectrum. Recently, Fama [1984], Jones and Roley [1983], Mankiw and Summers [1984], and Shiller, Campbell, and Schoenholtz [1983] all conclude that yields on Treasury bills of less than one year do not obey the expectations theory. While stories of highly variable risk premiums, changing asset supplies, or segmented markets might explain the failure of very long-term yields to behave according to the theory, such stories seem less plausible applied to the markets for three-month and six-month bills.
w3108|Economic theory has trouble explaining strikes.1 As stated by Hart (1989), "The difficulty is to understand why rational parties should resort to a wasteful mechanism as a way of distributing the gains from trade. Why could not both parties be made better off by moving to the final distribution of surplus immediately [ ] and sharing the benefits from increased production?" A similar objection to developing a coherent theory of strikes is what Kennan (1986) calls the "Hicks paradox", namely: "The main obstacle is that if one has a theory which predicts when a strike will occur and what the outcome will be, the parties can agree to this outcome in advance, and so avoid the costs of a strike. If they do this, the theory ceases to hold. [ ] If the parties are rational, it is difficult to see why they would fail to negotiate a Pareto optimal outcome." This paradox has been resolved by resorting to informational imperfections, in particular asymmetric information. Indeed, it is often thought that there are no other possible culprits for these inefficiencies.^ Card (1988), for example, asserts that "It has long been recognized that any consistent theoretical model of strikes must appeal to some form of imperfect information.
w4373|This paper seeks to address two fundamental and related questions about the housing market: 1) What accounts for fluctuations in house prices? and 2) Why is it that there appears to be more intense trading activity (ie, a higher volume of sales; and a shorter average waiting time from listing to sale) in rising markets than in falling markets? The standard theoretical approach to the first question (as exemplified by Poterba (1984)) treats the housing market much like any other asset market. In this framework, house prices are forward looking and depend solely on such current and future "fundamentals" as user costs of capital, rents, and construction costs. However, this "efficient markets" approach to house price determination has encountered empirical difficulties. Case and Shiller (1989, 1990) present evidence that changes in house prices are forecastable, based on both past price changes and on such fundamental-based measures as rent-to-price and construction-cost-to-price ratios.1 Furthermore, there have been a number of dramatic boom-to-bust episodes at both the country and regional levels that appear to be difficult to explain---even retrospectively---with the standard model.2 Many observers have concluded from these sorts of data that house prices are in part driven by non-fundamental speculative phenomena such as fads or bubbles.
w2680|Economists are increasingly aware of the importance of heterogeneity among individuals for issues in macroeconomics. One such issue is the interaction between individual income uncertainty and tax policy. Since an individual's personal tax liability is typically contingent on his income, and since future income is uncertain, future taxes provide a form of insurance. This insurance effect of income taxes has normative implications regarding the desirability of the taxes (Varian, 1980) and positive implications regarding their impact on consumption and saving (Chan, 1983; Barsky, Mankiw, Zeldes, 1986).1 The purpose of this paper is to study the response of consumption to the timing of labor income taxes. We assume that individuals are infinitely lived, so that the taxes do not redistribute across generations. We also assume that labor supply is inelastic, so that the taxes are not distortionary. The failure of Ricardian equivalence in our model is fully attributable to the insurance effect of the income tax system. This failure of Ricardian equivalence, which was discussed by Barro (1974, p. 1115) and Tobin (1980, p. 59-60), was first analyzed explicitly by Chan using a two-period model. Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes argued that this insurance effect is likely to be quantitatively important; they examined multi-period examples but only through the use of computer simulations and under the assumption that income is independently distributed in each period. Here we allow individual income to follow a Markov process.
w9889|In modern industrial organization, there has recently been a growth in the number of empirical papers that use a structural econometric modelling approach to analyze data on firm and consumer behavior. One of the most active research areas in this line of work has been on the analysis of auction data. As pointed out by the inﬂuential survey of Laffont and Vuong (1996), auction models appear especially well-suited to base structural econometric models on “because of the availability of many data sets and the well-defined game forms associated with auctions.
w2086|Over the last decade, there has been a growing awareness that many-important public policy issues turn critically upon the assumed nature of economic relationships within the family. This awareness is largely attributable to seminal papers by Robert Barro [1974] and Gary Becker [19T4 ] âffiBarro's paper ostensibly concerns the national debt, but its implications are much more far-reaching. Specifically, Barro supplemented the traditional overlapping generations model with intergenerational altriusm, and argued, in essence, that voluntary transfers between parents and children cause the representative "dynastic" family to behave as though it is a single, infinite-lived individual.
w0421|Over the past several years there has been considerable activity in formulating life cycle models of labor supply. The crucial implication of this work is that hours of work is a function of both current and future wages, as well as such variables as wealth and the worker's future prospects. Most of this work has gone unnoticed in the empirical literature. This study synthesizes existing knowledge into an estimable model of labor supply that incorporates life cycle factors, and relates it to empirical models typically found in the literature. A full life cycle model of hours of work is estimated using data on prime age males from the Michigan Panel on Income Dynamics. Most empirical work on labor supply ignores life cycle theory, assuming instead a one-period model. Typically, annual hours of work are regressed on the current hourly wage rate and some measure of property income. A worker, however, determines his current labor supply in a life cycle setting. Unless credit markets are "perfectly imperfect" and there is no human capital accumulation, the supply of labor is a function of current and future discounted wage rates as well as wealth and constraints in other periods.
w0405|A major goal of government policy is to affect the income distribution between individuals in society. There are, however, other social institutions which affect the income distribution and their actions may either reinforce or countervail those of the government. The family plays a major role in this respect. The effect of the family on the distribution of income depends on the variation in individual characteristics within and between families and on the rules for allocation of family resources. We are interested in a particular aspect of this problem: the allocation of parental resources among children of different abilities and its effect on the distribution of their future income and welfare. The nature of the problem can be illustrated by means of a very simple example. Consider two families, each consisting of two children. Let the parents of each family have the same wealth. Children are distinguished solely by their endowed ability. Suppose that half the children's population is of 'high ability' and half of 'low ability.' One possibility is that all differences in ability are within families and hence each family has one 'able' and one 'less able' child.
w2088|Over the past several years, a large number of less-developed countries have repeatedly "rescheduled" their payments on loans from Western banks.1 These reschedulings have typically involved only a postponement of payments (with interest) rather than outright repudiation, but many observers are skeptical whether the loans will ever be repaid in full. In the (limited) secondary market for LDC loans, bank loans to many countries --- particularly South American debtors---trade at substantial discounts.2 There is also evidence that anticipated LDC loan losses are reflected in the stock market values of major creditor banks.3 Given that the net external liabilities of all developing countries stood at over 950 billion dollars by the end of 1985 *, it is not surprising that the "LDC debt crisis" has attracted a great deal of attention. (The Appendix presents figures for some of the major individual borrowers.) An essential feature of sovereign lending is that creditors have only indirect means to enforce repayment. As a consequence, countries may choose to default long before the stage is reached where they are literally unable to pay.
w0891|There is substantial agreement in macroeconomics about the importance of inventory behavior in the business cycle. There is however little agreement beyond that, for exainple on the issue of whether inventory behavior is stabilizing or destabilizing. Although there exists a widely accepted standard inventory equation (Lovell, 1961), it has been shown (Feldstein and Auerbach, 1976) that the empirical estimates obtained in these equations partly contradict the theory from which these equations are derived.
w3201|The life history of a technology-intensive commodity can be quite complex. Consider the recent life of the personal computer (PC). Ever since IBM introduced the 8088-based IBM PC in the early 1980's, we have witnessed a more or less continuous race between IBM, Compaq, and others to provide products of ever higher quality. This quality competition has led to the almost complete replacement of the 8088-based computers by machines housing an 80286 processor, and more recently these latter PC's are losing their place in the market to computers based on the 80386 processor. At the same time, other firms, many of them located in low wage countries such as Taiwan and Korea, have strived to copy the state-of-the-art machines and to come to market with competitively priced "clones". As a result, market shares have fluctuated for innovators and imitators, and for last generation and next generation products.
w4714|Following AlJyn Young (1928), much of the recent theoretical work on economic growth builds on increasing returns to scale in production. Unlike models based on neoclassical production functions, these models suggest that steady-state per capita growth rates are not independent of initial conditions.' Romer (1983 and 1986), Lucas (1988), Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny (1989), Rebelo (1991) and others use increasing returns so that initial levels are positively correlated with later growth rates and the endogenous portion of growth continues indefinitely. Under particular assumptions, these models suggest that the the world's lead economy will display divergence over time and often they also predict that the cross-section of the world's economies will also not show convergence.
w2627|After a long period of neglect, economists have recently begun to systematically analyze the role that self-employment plays in the labor market. This developing literature has already established a few interesting empirical regularities regarding the determinants of self-employment rates and the compensation of self-employed persons. For example, Blau (1987) finds that changes in tax laws and technology account for a large fraction of the observed increase in self-employment rates over the last two decades; Lazear and Moore (1984) document that the ageffearnings profiles of self-employed persons are substantially flatter than the ageffearnings profiles of salaried workers; and Evans and Leighton (1987) show that the transition rates into and out of self-employment are independent of age and labor market experience. It is also well known (Moore 1983; Borjas 1986) that there exist sizable differences in the characteristics of the self-employment sector across ethnicffracial groups. In particular, whites have larger self-employment rates and incomes than blacks or Hispanics. This fact is hard to interpret in the traditional framework of an employer discrimination model since self-employed persons have no reason to discriminate against themselves.'' This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of the differences in both self-employment rates and incomes across racial groups. Our maintained hypothesis is that these differences are generated by consumer discrimination, whereby white consumers dislike purchasing goods and services from blacks and other minorities (Becker 1971) .
w3414|Economic growth has posed an intellectual challenge ever since the beginning of systematic economic analysis, Adam Smith claimed Chat growth was related to the division of labor, but he did riot link them in a clear way. Thomas Malthus developed a formal model of a dynamic growth process, â¢in which each country converged toward a stationary per capita income. According to his model, death rates fall and fertility rises when incomes exceed the equilibrium level, and the opposite occurs when incomes are less than that level. Despite the influence of the Malthusian model on nineteenth century economists, fertility fell rather than rose as incomes grew during the past 150 years in the West and other parts of the world. The neoclassical model of growth responded to the failure of the Malthusian model by essentially ignoring any link between population and the economy. Adjustments in this model take place not in the population growth rate, but in the rate of investment in physical capital.
w9179|In every society present generations choose how much to invest in Intergenerational Public Goods (IPGs), such as public capital and the environment, and how much debt to pass to future generations. This gives rise to a basic question in political economy: Which institutions best protect future generations from expropriation and generate optimal investment in IPGs? This institutional problem is challenging because future generations do not vote, and the evidence suggests that present generations are imperfectly altruistic.
w0599|This paper studies exchange-rate determination and the external adjustment process in a world of infinitely-lived, utility-maximizing households. The setting is similar to the one proposed by Kouri (1976), in that agents are assumed to consume a single good, to hold domestic money, and to have access to a world market in consumption loans. But the approach departs from the one prevalent in the recent balance-of-payments literature by basing saving behavior and money demand on explicit, intertemporal utility maximization.''" The framework for the analysis is adapted from the seminal work of Sidrauski (1967), as extended to the context of perfect foresight by Brock (1974), Calvo (1979a), and Fischer (1979). In contrast to these contributions, however, the model explored below allows agents' rate of time preference to be endogenously determined in a manner suggested by Uzawa (1968), rather than fixed.2 This modification permits the small economy we study to attain a stationary long-run equilibrium under conditions of perfect capital mobility. 2 a The plan of the paper, and its main results, are as follows. Guillermo Calvo suggested the line of investigation pursued in this paper.
w2107|Only a small segment of existing public finance literature deals explicitly with the regional effects of taxes, and little of it is numerical in orientation. And yet in many countries the regional dimensions of economic policy are increasingly coming to the fore in debates on both tax and other issues. Taxes which affect products heavily produced in particular regions are often seen as regionally unfair. Regional tax exporting is a further contentious issue, either through deductibility of regional or local taxes at national level, or through tax induced changes in the interregional terms of trade. And there is further debate as to the effects of taxes on regional factor mobility. In part, the lack of literature dealing with these issues is a reflection of the difficulties of regional modelling. Data is often poor, and the most appropriate analytic structure within which these issues, and especially interregional factor mobility, can be adequately captured is not clear from existing literature. But despite these problems the importance of regional dimensions in tax policy design remains.
w4861|One of the distinctive and puzzling features of the housing market is the dramatic variation in real prices and sales volume over time. In the United States, for example, total sales of existing homes increased from 1.6 million in 1970 to 3.8 million in 1979, and then fell 50 percent by 1982 (National Association of Realtors 1993). Over that same time period, real prices rose 41 percent, and then declined by almost one-seventh. Regional changes are even more dramatic.1 The implications of such fluctuations in the real estate market are significant given that the portfolio of most households is heavily concentrated in real estate.
w1129|This paper deals with the current account adjustment over time of an economy which is subject to changes in its terms of trade and world interest rates. One obvious reason to analyze the current account is that governments and policymakers care about it, and intervene to affect it. The goal is often said to be a balanced current account, although from the point of view of economic theory that has no particular virtue. What is at stake is of course what might be, in some sense, the optimal current account, and whether observed actual current accounts deviate from the optimal ones. In order to specify what might be optimal, we must first understand how the equilibrium current account of a relatively frictionless economy is determined, and what the equilibrium response to various disturbances look like. Another obvious reason is that international economists like to explain international capital movements, which immediately leads to the current account since it is identically equal to a country's net accumulation of foreign assets.
w4313|Externalities and other sources of increasing returns in the aggregate technology provide a foundation for a number of new developments in aggregate economics. In fluctuations theory, increasing returns due to externalities seem a promising way to explain the volatility of output --- the volatility is a puzzle in a convex neoclassical economy. In growth theory, aggregate increasing returns permits endogenous growth, also prohibited by neoclassical technology. And the recent upsurge of interest in the theory of regional and urban agglomeration rests on increasing returns associated with transportation and other coordination costs. Previous research (Hall [1990]) has suggested that increasing returns has an important role in explaining year-to-year movements in productivity. Caballero and Lyons [1992] argued that externalities are the most persuasive explanation of the observed extent of increasing returns. Earlier work has also pointed out the close connection between the study of the distribution of economic activity over time and over space (Hall [1991]). There is a substantial theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration effects relating to the size of cities. Our purpose in this paper is to look at the spatial dimension empirically within a framework where spatial density appears explicitly. The source of increasing returns studied here is density. By density we mean simply the intensity of labor and capital relative to 2 physical space. Density is high when there is a large amount of labor and capital per square foot.
w1400|In conventional Keynesian macroeconomic models, a debt-financed tax cut stimulates aggregate demand. As Tobin I198O] discusses, this effect is central to the traditional conclusions that tax changes might have a useful role in short-run stabilization policy and that persistent government deficits reduce the steady-state capital stock. This view of debt finance is implicit in many policy discussions regarding the large current Federal deficits. One possible objection to this conventional view, first noted by Ricardo, is that it ignores the future tax liabilities implicit in debt finance. In any finite horizon model, for example, the government mist at some point levy taxes to repay the debt. The present value of the future taxes exactly equals the value of the debt. If the planning horizon of individuals is at least as long as the horizon over which the debt is repaid, then the replacement of current taxes with future taxes could not increase individuals' perceived wealth. In this world, therefore, government bonds do not stimulate consumer spending.
w2540|International economists have long used static models of comparative advantage and (more recently) scale economies to great advantage in studying the pattern of international trade and the normative properties of trading equilibria. But increasingly, many issues of concern to theorists and casual observers alike are inherently dynamic in nature. Attention has focused on such topics as the creation of comparative advantage by technological innovation, the relationship between trade policy and economic growth, and the dynamic evolution of the volume and pattern of world trade. The static models of international trade must be extended if we are to deal with these new concerns. In this paper, we develop a multi-country, dynamic, general equilibrium model of product innovation and international trade to study the creation of comparative advantage through research and development, and the evolution of world trade over time.
w6771|The fiscal theory states that the price level is determined by the government budget constraint, nominal debt , . -:- = present value of real surpluses. (1) price level The fiscal theory is developed by Leeper (1991), Sims (1994) Woodford (1995, 1996) and Dupor (1997) with one-period debt. Cochrane (1998) reviews the fiscal theory and argues for its plausibility. At heart, the fiscal theory recognizes that even apparently unbacked fiat money is in the end valued by its backing from real government resources rather than by a liquidity value in exchange. In the fiscal theory, money and nominal debt are essentially valued as equity claims on the government. Well-understood backing regimes such as credible commodity standards and currency boards are transparent instances of the fiscal theory; the theory argues that their price determination mechanisms apply more broadly.
w1122|The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of the cyclical variability of manufacturing investment. The prevailing "neoclassical" theory of investment developed by Jorgenson (1963), and extended by Hall and Jorgenson (1967), Eisner and Nadiri (1968), and Bischoff (1971) among others, does not provide a completely satisfactory explanation of the determinants of business investment. The dissatisfaction with the estimated neoclassical investment equations is not based on the "fit" of these equations or on shifts in these equations; rather, the problem arises from the difficulty of interpreting the estimated distributed lags. Are we to interpret these distributed lags as expectational lags, as delivery lags, or perhaps, more likely, as some convolution of expectationa1 and delivery lags? An alternative approach to the estimation of investment equations uses the q theory of investment Tobin (1969) which is based on the cost of adjustment literature developed by Eisner and Strotz (1963), Lucas (1967a, b), Gould (1968), and Treadway (1969).
w15342|A growing literature has documented substantial and systematic variation in export performance across firms. More productive firms are more likely to export, have higher export revenues, and enter more markets.1 These patterns are consistent with early heterogeneous firm models that emphasize efficiency sorting across firms: more productive firms become more successful exporters because they have lower marginal costs and charge lower prices.2 Recent evidence, however, suggests that larger exporters pay higher wages and are more skill and capital intensive. Moreover, exporters charge higher prices than non-exporters, and plant size is positively correlated with output and input prices.3 To rationalize these facts while retaining the advantages of the efficiency sorting framework, recent models have introduced quality differentiation across firms: more productive firms have superior export performance because they sell higher quality goods at higher prices.4 1 See for example Clerides, Lach and Tybout (1998), Aw, Chung and Roberts (2000), Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2004, 2008) and Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2009), and Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (2007) for a survey of the literature. 2 See Melitz (2003), Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and Kortum (2003) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). 3 See Bernard and Jensen (1995), Verhoogen (2008), Kugler and Verhoogen (2008), Hallak and Sivadasan (2008) and Iacovone and Javorcik (2008). 4 See Johnson (2007), Baldwin and Harrigan (2007), Verhoogen (2008), Kugler and Verhoogen (2008), Hallak and Sivadasan (2008) and Kneller and Yu (2008). This paper examines the variation in free on board (fob) export prices across firms, products and destinations using detailed proprietary data on the universe of Chinese trading firms. We establish five stylized facts which allow us to distinguish between alternative heterogeneous firm models. Our results are consistent with quality sorting across firms and firms adjusting both quality and mark-ups across destinations in response to market toughness. Since existing models assume either no quality differentiation across firms or no quality differentiation within a firm across trade partners, however, they are unable to explain the patterns in the data. Our findings thus point to previously unexplored dimensions of firm heterogeneity and adjustments on the quality margin within firms across destinations. First, we establish that, among exporters selling in a given destination-product market, firms charging higher fob prices earn bigger revenues. When we look at the variation in worldwide exports across firms trading a given product, we also find a positive correlation between firms' average export price, worldwide sales and number of export destinations.
w8525|Theoretical links between economic performance and the use of information, such as those in Hayek's (1945) famous analysis of economic organization, are at the core of a recurring theme in the productivity literature: the premise that information technology (IT) offers opportunities for large productivity gains. Empirical evidence showing links between IT diffusion and productivity has been scarce until recently, however.1 Researchers in the field refer to this as "the productivity paradox." The difficulty of finding relationships between IT use and productivity using aggregate data is well-summarized by Solow's oft-cited observation: "You can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics.
w2233|Structural econometric models often make use of large information sets in forecasting a given variable. The information sets used in large-scale macroeconometric models are typically so large that the number of predetermined variables exceeds the number of observations available for estimating the model. Estimation can proceed effectively only because of the large number of a-priori restrictions imposed on the model, restrictions that do not work out to be simple exclusion restrictions on the reduced form equation for the variable forecasted. The a-priori restrictions make the model an aggregator of information, an aggregator that could not have been produced without the restrictions.
w11462|Districting plans, which allocate voters across districts for the purpose of electing representa- tives to a central legislature, are frequently perceived as unfair to voters of certain ideologies or race. These perceptions of unfairness have lead to conﬂicts over how district lines should be drawn. As computer technology and the information available to officials charged with districting have improved, districting plans have become more refined, and these conﬂicts between groups of voters have intensified. As a result of these conﬂicts, courts have become more involved in the process, and independent commissions have been established in some cases to oversee the districting process.
w16007|Consumers often transact with imperfect information about the best price available for a product. Some examples are mundane---a shopper does not know the price of kleenex at every nearby store. Others are more substantial, such as the best available price for a new Ford Focus or the best expense ratio for an S&P 500-indexed mutual fund. We study a large expenditure that the majority of consumers make only a few times in their lives, the payment for mortgage origination services. These payments range from zero to $30,000 for mortgages of normal size. The payments are described as "origination fees," "points," and a myriad of other terms; frequently the borrower pays for a dozen or more different categories of origination services. On average among the loans we study, about half of the value that the borrower transfers to the broker takes the form of a payment by the wholesale lender to the mortgage broker. The borrower bears the burden of this part of the payment in the form of a higher interest rate on the loan.
w5788|Of the consumers who participated in the Federal Reserve Board's 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, 43 percent said that being prepared for emergencies was the most important reason for saving. Only 15 percent said that preparing for retirement was the most important saving motive.' These are not the answers that standard interpretations of the Life CycleffPermanent Income Hypothesis (LCffPIH) model of saving would lead one to expect. This paper will argue, however, that such responses, and a wide range of other evidence, are consistent with a version of the LCffPIH model in which consumers face important income uncertainty, but are also both "prudent," in Miles Kimball's [1990b] sense that they have a precautionary saving motive, and "impatient" in the sense that if future income were known with certainty they would choose to consume more than their current income.
w5637|A contract written in nominal terms exposes the parties to price-level risk. Full indexation to the price level is a device for eliminating such risk. Our paper shows that when nominal data are gathered with delay, a fully indexed contract would be renegotiated by the parties to that contract. That is, fully indexed contracts are not time consistent, not renegotiation proof. But contracts that specify an uncontingent nominal payment are not renegotiation-proof either. When contracts are not fully indexed, monetary policy will affect the real terms of those contracts, and hence it will affect real variables. In general; three types of explanation have been proposed for how money affects real variables: "Menu Costs" models assume it is costly to change prices ffi Sheshinski and Weiss (1977).
w4518|Discrimination in the labor market has generated immense amounts of research by economists. Many alternative theoretical analyses of the nature of discrimination and a vast empirical literature have been produced. (See, eg, Cain's, 1986, review.) In the US alone careful empirical studies of possibly discriminatory outcomes involving blacks, Hispanics, women, linguistic minorities, physically handicapped workers and no doubt others have been produced.1 Our purpose here is to offer the first study of the economics of discrimination in the labor market against yet another group---the ugly ---and its obverse, possible favoritism for the beautiful.
w2988|Time is scarce; and, more than any other single activity in which people engage, sleeping occupies that scarce time. Economists, and labor economists especially, have devoted immense effort to studying how consumers allocate time, but we have almost entirely ignored the empirical study of choices about time spent sleeping.' For example, in a detailed analysis of time allocation Kooreman-Kapteyn (1987) estimate a demand system involving seven categories of leisure time use. However, sleep is mentioned only once in this study, when it is noted that time spent sleeping is to be grouped with various waking activities in a "personal needs and care fiitalics ours]" category. Stafford-Duncan (1980) noted a negative correlation between wages and sleep time, but dismissed it as resulting from unmeasured individual differences. We have essentially banished from our analysis of scarcity the consideration of roughly one-third of humankind's available allotment of time. The failure to consider sleep is widespread in other social sciences.
w2679|As rational expectations have become a popular benchmark in thinking financial and macroeconomic hypotheses, many economists have become more interested in directly measuring expectations of market participants. Although survey data on many domestic variables, including interest rates and inflation rates, have been frequently analyzed bv many investigators (see, for example, Mishkin (1983; ch. 4)), it is onlv recently that survey data on foreign exchange rates have become available and been analyzed. Dominguez (1986) and Frankel and Froot (1987a,b) have exploited the survey data made available by the Money Market Service (MMS). the Amex Bank Review and the Economist Financial Report.'" The surveys that were investigated by Dominguez. and by Frankel and Froot have only their median responses reported. Heterogeneity among the market participants, if it existed, is aggregated out.
w3322|and Summary Becker and Murphy (1988) develop a theoretical model of rational addiction and outline its key empirical predictions. This paper uses that framework to analyze empirically the demand for cigarettes. The data consist of per capita cigarette sales (in packs) annually by state for the period 1955 through 1985. The empirical results indicate that smoking is addictive. The Becker-Murphy model follows Stigler and Becker (1977), Iannaccone (1986), Ryder and Heal (1973), Boyer (1978, 1983), and Spinnewyn (1981) by considering the interaction of past and current consumption in a rational model. The main feature of these models is that past consumption of some goods influences their current consumption by affecting the marginal utility of current and future consumption. Greater past consumption of harmfully addictive goods such as cigarettes stimulates current consumption by increasing the marginal utility of current consumption more than the present value of the marginal harm from future consumption. Therefore, past consumption is reinforcing for addictive goods.
w2871|Although over 90 percent of employed workers hold jobs that are covered by the unemployment insurance system, less than 30 percent of unemployed workers currently receive unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, This fraction has fallen over the postwar era, with notable declines in cue early 1960s and the early 1980s. The decline in the past decade is especially puzzling since it has occurred at the same time that the fraction of women in the labor force has stabilized and the baby boom has matured.
w4407|In the past two decades, many researchers have analyzed the effects of government transfer programs on labor supply behavior among the low income population. Most of the earlier work focused primarily on estimating the work disincentive effects of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the largest means tested welfare program providing cash benefits to the low-income population. More recently, this literature has been extended to study the impact of the combination of cash benefits and in-kind benefits on labor supply behavior.
w4646|There are three widely available indicators of technological change: (i) measures of research input, such as employment of research scientists and engineers, (ii) measures of inventive output, in particular counts of patented inventions, and (iii) measures of the improvement in technologies in use, such as total factor productivity growth. These indicators, if taken seriously, are quite informative as to which models are capable of organizing our empirical understanding of technological change. I propose a model which, in a steady state equilibrium, replicates the observed aggregate trends in research, patenting, and productivity. These aggregate implications follow from a stochastic model of research, patenting, and productivity growth at the level of individual products. Figure I illustrates the behavior of the three technology indicators in the US over the past three decades (see table 2 for data sources). For ease of comparison, the three series are indexed at zero (on a log scale) in 1957.
w17624|The simultaneous bid auction is a standard method for sellers to solicit offers from buyers. A simple alternative is for a seller to ask buyers to make offers sequentially. If it is costly for buyers to participate, the sequential mechanism will tend to be more efficient than the simultaneous auction because later potential buyers can condition their participation decisions on earlier bids. However, the sequential mechanism's greater efficiency may not produce higher revenues because while the possibility of deterring later potential entrants can lead early bidders to bid aggressively, the fact that later firms might be deterred will tend to reduce revenues. The relative revenue performance of the mechanisms will therefore depend on whether the threat of potential future competition, which can raise bids in the sequential mechanism, is more valuable to the seller than actual competition, which will tend to be greater in the simultaneous auction.
w0870|There is now a considerable volume of evidence to suggest that unionized labor markets operate differently in a number of respects from non-unionized labor markets. However, in general, these findings have been reported with little attempt to relate these empirical regularities to the objectives of and constraints on the decision-making units involved. Consequently, our understanding of "what may trade unions maximize?" has advanced only a trifle from the time that John Dunlop fil9l*l*] first raised the question almost 1*0 years ago. The prevailing opinion appears to be that the problem of modelling trade union behavior is "virtually intractable" fiJohnson, 1975]âffiThe purpose of this paper is to belie this notion. We adopt a characterization similar to Dunlop's for the determination of wages and employment in unionized markets and we apply this model to a particular institutional setting. Our objective is not to endorse the specific model of the trade union outlined here, but simply to demonstrate that the investigation of union goals is fully amenable to empirical analysis. The data examined here describe the wages and employment of members of the International Typographical Union for ten cities over the 20 years from I9U6 to 1965. This is a truly extraordinary union whose features are well suited to the particular model outlined.
w0685|A striking feature of the recent experience with flexible exchange rates has been the widely-observed sensitivity of nominal wages and national price levels to exchange-rate fluctuations.1 The close link between the exchange rate and domestic prices, operating through both demand-side substitution between home and tradable goods and through resistance in the labor market to real wage cuts, has helped undermine early beliefs-as expressed, for example, by Johnson [22]-that a regime of market-determined exchange rates can enhance the efficacy of monetary policy as a stabilization tool while ensuring balance-of-payments equilibrium.2 indeed, much recent policy discussion has centered on the possibility that freely floating exchange rates may be inherently unstable. This "vicious circle" view of the current arrangements holds that inflationary asset-market disturbances entail short-term exchange-rate movements which feed into domestic price levels and may set off successive, explosive rounds of wage-price inflation and further exchangerate depreciation.3 The concern is reflected in the emphasis on exchangerate surveillance in the revised Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, in the adoption of informal exchange-rate targets by most central banks, and in the emergence of more formal arrangements to limit the degree of exchange-rate flexibility, such as the European Monetary System.
w2403|This paper develops a simple but general theory of the determinants of the international pattern of trade in risky assets. The importance of international trade in risky assets is obvious, with increased liberalization of international capital movements, and with the observation that in practice all assets are risky in the sense that their real returns are uncertain.1 Yet it seems that there is much less research done on the pattern of trade in explicitly risky assets than on the pattern of trade in goods. The theory is developed by borrowing from and synthesizing several strands of literature. Ve start from the modern formulations of standard international trade theory, more precisely the general law of comparative advantage as developed by Deardorff (1980) and Dixit and Norman (1980).
w4650|The recent literature has given considerable attention to the hypothesis thai fluctuationÂ« in aggregate economic activity result from stochastic variation* in the ratÂ« of technical progress (Kydland and Prescott, 1082; Prescott, 1986; King, Phaser and Rebelo, 1988a, 19Sflb; Plosser, 1989). One of the most appealing features of this "real business cycle" (RBC) hypothesis is its parsimony - it is proposed that the same exogenous changes in the available production technology that determine the long-run changes in output per head also account for short-run variations in output and employment. Rather than a putile to be explained through the invocation of a complex mechanism that is introduced into one's model of the economy solely for that purpose, the business cycle is actually a necessary consequence of stochastic growth.
w7856|Between 1978 and 1998 GDP per capita in the People's Republic of China, as reported in official statistics, grew 8.0% per annum, a performance which makes China the most rapidly growing economy in the world during this period, as well as all of recorded human history.1 While the unprecedented growth of the Chinese economy can be taken as evidence of the success of its economic reforms, its breathtaking magnitude and inordinate endurance has led others to seek less favourable, statistical, explanations. Thus, Summers and Heston, in version 5.6 of their popular international data set, cite the fact that "it is widely felt that fiChina's] growth rates are too high" and, accordingly, arbitrarily lower the reported growth of consumption and investment during the 1980-1993 period by 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively fiSummers and Heston 1994]. In this paper I take a slightly different approach. Rather than discount the Chinese statistical record, I embrace it.
w13370|Conversation is a central part of economic life. A wide range of information gets passed along from one person to another via word-of-mouth communication, and a number of authors have argued that the nature and extent of connections between people---ie, the structure of social networkscan have a profound influence on how far and how efficiently information spreads across the economy.1 For example, in the context of financial markets, Shiller (2000, p. 155) writes: 'Word-of-mouth transmission of ideas appears to be an important contributor to day-to-day or hour-to-hour stock market fluctuations." In many sorts of conversations, it can be taken more or less for granted that the participants will communicate honestly with one another. If one friend asks another for her opinion of a restaurant, movie, vacation spot, etc., it is hard to see why the response would be anything other than completely truthful. However, there are also a number of important cases where it is less immediately obvious that an honest exchange of information can be expected.
w0991|and summary of results This paper examines the trade-balance response to changes in world oil prices and interest rates for a small oil-importing open econoi^. The theoretical interest in this problem is, of course, derived from the oil price increases in 1973-1+ and 1979-80 and the resulting huge surpluses in OPEC current accounts and trade balances, and corresponding overall deficits vis-a-vis OPEC in the rest of the world. World markets have since then been flooded by OPEC's supply of credit, and there is evidence that world real interest rates fell during the 1970s.1 By now, starting with the works ty, among others, Schmid 11976], Findlay and Rodrigues [19771, Buiter ÃÂÃÂ19T8], and Bruno and Sachs fil979l, there exists a lar6e literature on many theoretical macroeconoinic aspects of these events. Tb the extent that this literature has dealt with determinants of the current account, it has, however, mostly used a rather static approach and even overlooked obvious and important interten$>oral aspects. Whether the current account balance is described in terms of export minus import or equivalent^ as income minus absorption, it has rarely been seen as the outcome of intertemporal decisions on saving and investment. As argued by Sachs Il9Bl, p.
w3706|In 1969, the French economist Arghiri Emmanuel wrote a paper on what he termed the "unequal exchange" which resulted from the "imperialism of trade." He postulated that the equalization of real wages, which stems from free trade, leads to efficiency losses, and to a "widening of fithe] gap between rich and poor nations."1 Emmanuel argued that countries, especially those that are less developed, should be aware of this result, and should take it into consideration when deciding their trading policies.5 As the global economy becomes increasingly integrated, the need to explore the effects of trade liberalization on incomes is becoming ever more important. The objective of this paper is to empirically examine the behavior of cross-country income differentials over time, within a specified group of countries, and to investigate how they might be affected by the removal of trade barriers.
w11676|of DVDs Julie Holland Mortimer NBER Working Paper No. 11676 September 2005 JEL No. L0, O3 ABSTRACT This paper examines the welfare effects of intellectual property protection, accounting for firms' optimal responses to legal environments and technological innovation. I examine firms' use of indirect price discrimination in response to US copyright law, which effectively prevents direct price discrimination. Using data covering VHS and DVD movie distribution, I explain studios' optimal pricing strategies under US copyright law, and determine optimal pricing strategies under EU copyright law, which allows for direct price discrimination. I analyze these optimal pricing strategies for both the existing VHS technology and the new digital DVD technology. I find that studios' use of indirect price discrimination under US copyright law benefits consumers and harms retailers.
w3981|Traditional measures of productivity growth typically neglect forces external to firms. In fact, they tend to Ignore both external and Internal scale effects in the long and short run by assuming constant returns to scale in measured Inputs and Instantaneous adjustment. However, both external and Internal economies may greatly affect short and long run economic performance, since they affect the observed relationship between costs and output. Public Infrastructure Investment is an Important example of a good which could generate external economies. If expenditures on public capital have a positive productive impact â¢âffiand thus cause cost savings for firms which are currently experiencing economic difficulties the implications for policy decisions concerning Infrastructure Investment may be great. Internal effects such as long run scale economies and short run fixities are also Important to recognize for evaluation of productive performance.
w11506|A recent antitrust suit charged that the National Resident Matching Program suppresses the wages of medical residents. The match, which uses a Gale-Shapley procedure to assign seniors in medical schools to residency programs in various med- ical specialties, was developed for efficiency reasons, and on that score it appears to do quite well.1 That is, the right residents appear to get assigned to pretty much the right residency programs. At the same time, for young doctors who have just com- pleted four years of medical school, salaries are low, averaging around $40,000 per year, and compressed, and work hours are long, 80 hours a week in many programs.2 While salary differentials are only one way in which residency programs might com- pete, the compression of salaries within programs, within specialties, and across fields is remarkable, compared to the variation in pay among more senior doctors.
w2229|The dichotomy between trend and cycle has played an important role in both classical and Keynesian analyses of economic fluctuations. The prevailing view seems to be that fluctuations arise from temporary disturbances that are sometimes associated with variations in monetary and fiscal policies. These shocks are then propagated by the economic system in ways that result in systematic patterns of persistence and co-movements among key economic series. Secular trends, while also related across series, are viewed as evolving slowly through time and having little influence on the quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year variations in economic conditions. This view, compounded by a lack of statistical techniques for investigating stochastically trending variables, has dominated macroeconomic research. Empirical evidence presented by Nelson and Plosser (1982) and others questions the validity of this traditional dichotomy.
w10548|There is a huge literature suggesting that stock prices movements reﬂect the market’s expectation of future developments in the economy. As a test of standard valuation models, Fama [1990] shows that monthly, quarterly and annual stock returns are highly correlated with future production growth rates for 1953-1987. This result is confirmed on a extended sample (1889-1988) by Schwert [1990]. Both authors argue that the relation between current stock returns and future production growth reﬂects information about future cash ﬂows that is impounded in stock prices.
w9069|The importance of price stickiness remains a central question in economics. After a ten-year period of relative quiet, sticky-price models are again at, or near, the center of analysis of business cycle fluctuations and monetary policy. Goodfriend and King (1997), Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2001), and Dotsey and King (2001) are examples of recent work built on the assumptions that firms adjust prices infrequently and satisfy all demand at those posted prices. With the exception of Dotsey and King (2001), these studies employ time-dependent pricing. Prices are maintained for a set number of periods (as in Taylor, 1999) or each period a fixed fraction of firms have an opportunity to adjust prices to new information (as in Calvo, 1983).
w2311|Historically-determined nominal prices can lead to inertia in the aggregate level of prices, leaving room for monetary shocks to influence real variables. Formal models connecting the microeconomic behavior of nominal prices with aggregate price stickiness include models with staggered price and wage decisions fiFischer, 1977; Taylor, 1980; Blanchard, 1983b; Parkin, 1986], models with partial adjustment of prices {eg, Rotemberg [1982]), and the more recent "menu cost" models of Akerlof and Yellen [1985], Blanchard and Kiyotaki [1985] and Mankiw [1985]. We present an alternative aggregate model with microeconomic price stickiness which emphasizes the importance of endogenous timing of price adjustments. The model provides conditions under which money shocks have no real effects. A number of macro economic models of price stickiness have a common microeconomic base: infrequent but large changes in nominal variables are assumed to be more economical then frequent small changes. The models also share the assumption that the time between successive price revisions is pre-set, and hence unresponsive to shocks to the economy.
w3788|The notion that social, cultural, and economic differences between immigrants and natives fade over the course of a few generations is the essence of the assimilation hypothesis.^ For many years, it was generally believed that the melting-pot metaphor correctly described important aspects of the ethnic experience in the United States. Over time, the children and grandchildren of immigrants moved out of ethnic enclaves, discarded their social and cultural background, and experienced economic mobility. After a few generations, the American-born descendants of the immigrants became indistinguishable from the native population. Recent sociological and historical research rejects the hypothesis that full assimilation is an unavoidable outcome of the ethnic experience. As Glazer and Moynihan [1963, p. xcvii] conclude in their classic study Beyond the Melting Pot: "The point about the melting pot [ ] is that it did not happen. [ ] The American ethos is nowhere better perceived than in the disinclination of the third and fourth generation of newcomers to blend into a standard, uniform national type." Current research in this literature (Perlmann, 1988; Steinberg, 1989] stresses the fact that the United States remains a multicultural, pluralistic society and cites as evidence the social, cultural, and economic differences that exist and persist among ethnic groups.
w8627|The Civil War was the most horrific war in United States history. The total number of deaths in the Civil War equaled the total number killed in almost all other wars combined and more than one out of every five white men participating died, over half of them from disease (Vinovskis 1990). The combatants faced death, the hardships and monotony of camp life, and distance from loved ones, all for low and irregular pay. One soldier wrote, "I have cursed the day I have enlisted for what benifit fisic] will I ever drive from being a Soldier. the common Soldier will not reap the Harvest of Victories but it is some other men that will gain all Praise Honor and Wealth."1 Had he deserted, he would have faced only a 40 percent chance of being caught and a negligible risk of death if arrested (Linderman 1987: 174, 176). A self-interested soldier would have deserted.
w4025|The investment return is the marginal rate at which a firm can transfer resources through time, by increasing investment today and decreasing it at a future date, leaving its production plan unchanged at all other dates. This paper examines whether cross-sectional and time-series variation in asset returns can be explained by a factor pricing model with investment returns as the factors. The basic idea is to infer the presence of systematic shocks by watching firms' investment decisions, just as the consumption-based model tries to infer the presence of systematic shocks by watching consumption decisions. This paper extends the work in Cochrane (1991a), which only tried to explain time-series variation in a single asset return. The techniques I use to estimate and test dynamic, conditional factor models are derived from the work of Hansen (1982), Hansen and Singleton (1982), Hansen and Richard (1987) and Hansen and Jagannathan (1991a).
w5136|A number of recent studies have testified to the benefits of private as opposed to state ownership of firms. One research strand compares private and state firms in the same line of activity, such as air transport or railroads, and finds the former to be more efficient (see Boardman and Vining, 1992, for a survey). A second strand reveals the improvements in a given company's operations following privatization (see Megginson et al., 1994). A third strand documents the lower cost of contracting public services to private suppliers than providing it publicly (see Donahue, 1989). This research makes a convincing case for the greater efficiency of private ownership. It is less clear from the existing research exactly how private ownership leads to greater efficiency.
w7470|This paper focuses on the issue of long term insurance in a world where risk types evolve over time. Health and life insurance are industries where this issue is important. In this environment, first best would involve full insurance against two sources of risk: the short term "event" risk that an accident will occur within a period, and the longer term "classification" risk, ie, the risk that future information about the consumer's type will lead to variability in future premiums. As was pointed out by Cochrane (1995), commitment by insurance companies to the future terms of the policies is not necessarily sufficient to guarantee that classification risk can be fully insured.
w17649|As is quite clear, Keynes' prediction and concern are far from having come to pass. Nonetheless, hours of market work did diminish in the US between 1900 and 1940 (Kniesner, 1976) and dropped sharply from 1950 through 1980 in most of Western Europe (Huberman and Minns, 2007). While Keynes' specific prediction was far from the mark, he got the general direction of change correct. Thus asking what people would do with their extra time if they were confronted with a large decline in market hours remains an interesting question. The difficulty in answering this question is that changes in individuals' time allocations arise from the interaction of changes in the technology of the production of Beckerian commodities with consumers' preferences for those commodities.
w18708|In Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer (BGS 2012a), we described a new approach to choice under risk that we called salience theory. In comparisons of risky lotteries, we argued, individuals' attention is drawn to those payoffs which are most different or salient relative to the average. In making choices, individuals overweight these salient payoffs relative to their objective probabilities. A simple formalization of such salience-based probability weighting provides an intuitive account of a variety of puzzling evidence in decision theory, such as Allais paradoxes and preference reversals. Salience theory naturally lends itself to the analysis of the demand for risky assets. After all, risky assets are lotteries evaluated in a context described by the alternative investments available in the market.
w3922|This paper investigates the response of industries to cyclical variations in demand in the framework of a vintage model of "creative destruction." Our premise is that the continuous process of creation and destruction of production units that results from product and process innovation is essential in understanding not only growth, but also business cycles.2 This idea goes back at least to Schumpeter (1939, 1942), although we do not go so far as to adopt his view that the process of creative destruction is itself a major source of economic fluctuations (as in Shleifer 1986), but only that it plays an important role in their transmission.
w7952|While this may seem exotic from a US perspective, many firms in the world are organized into so-called pyramids. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1999) find that approximately 25% of their sample firms are members of pyramids. In a pyramid, an ultimate owner uses indirect ownership to maintain control over a large group of companies. Figure 1 shows a stylized example. Here, the ultimate owner owns enough shares to control A (in this case assumed to be 20%). Firm A, in turn, owns controlling shares in firm B, and so on.
w9188|Should the rich favor the repeal of the estate tax? Not necessarily. By postponing tax payments until death, estate taxation may act like social security by reducing the present value of lifetime tax liability the longer one lives. To the extent that people subject to the estate tax do not face actuarially fair insurance markets,2 it may make perfect sense to raise at least part of tax revenue in the form of an estate tax. The key insight is that estate taxation can bring about a transfer from the (ex-post) short-living to long-living individuals. Assuming a risk-neutral government (or, simply, no aggregate mortality risk), the government may be able to transfer resources between different states of the world at actuarially fair rates without any loss in revenue (and thus without increasing the present value of taxes paid by a given individual).
w7815|Much of the empirical and theoretical work on agency issues concerns the tradeoff of risk and incentives. From this perspective, the cost of offering a pay-for-performance contract to a (risk averse) employee is that it imposes risk on his compensation, which causes higher wage costs. Consequently, when choosing higher performance pay, firms trade off the benefits of more effort against higher wage costs. The risk imposed on workers is increasing in the uncertainty of the environment so that the standard test of the tradeoff is to show that incentive pay is lower in more uncertain environments. Unfortunately, empirical research has not shown a convincing relationship between pay-for-performance and observed measures of uncertainty.
w5898|There is still much that we do not know about the effects of trade liberalization on environmental quality. Grossman and Krueger (1993) have argued that NAFTA may reduce pollution in part because it will raise incomes in Mexico and thereby create a demand for better enforcement of pollution regulations. On the other hand, there is some evidence that low-income countries with relatively weak pollution regulations are developing a comparative advantage in pollution-intensive industries (Low and Yeats, 1992). In general, we would expect that trade liberalization may sometimes benefit the environment and sometimes harm it.
w9076|Much recent theoretical work in international trade is based on increasing returns to scale of some kind. This includes models of intra-industry trade (Krugman, 1979, 1981; Helpman, 1981), multinational firms (Helpman, 1984; Markusen, 1984), and economic geography (Krugman, 1991; Venables, 1996). These efforts have produced compelling explanations for why similar countries may gain from trade, why most foreign direct investment tends to flow between rich countries, and why manufacturing activity tends to agglomerate spatially within countries. For purposes of empirical work, however, trade theories based on increasing returns present a problem.
w3477|Competition in the global economy has two faces: whereas US multinationals must vie with foreign firms in worldwide markets, Ihey often benefit from their ability to invest in foreign locations. Eager for the revenue and employment that American firms can provide, many foreign governments actively try to lure US business to their shores. In response, American firms now locate a significant and growing part of their foreign operations in tax havens, a group of countries with unusually low tax rates that has been extremely successful at attracting US business. From the standpoint of US tax policy, the widespread use of tax havens threatens the long-run sustainability of the US domestic tax base, since US multinational corporations may be able to shift some of their domestic income to low-tax offshore jurisdictions. At the same time, tax haven profits represent the richest possible foreign source of US tax revenue, since they generate few foreign tax credits to offset US tax due upon repatriation.
w3660|The ability of economic agents to communicate contributes 10 the efficiency of many economic activities and transactions. Production and distribution activities that involve teamwork, supervision, and the interpretation of written or verbal instructions require that workers communicate in a common language. In addition, the fact that language and culture are often intertwined suggests that economic agents may derive utility from communicating in a particular language, independent of the value of that language in the production and distribution of goods and services. The recognition of language as an economic variable was initiated in the seminal articles of Marschak (1965), Hocevar (1974), and Breton and Mieszkowski (1977) and furthered by the contributions of Vaillancourt (1980), Grenier (19:82), and Robinson (1988) . In the past few years, most of the research done on economic aspects of language has had an empirical orientation. Much effort has been devoted to testing the notion that the language abilities individuals possess are a genuine component of their overall human capital.
w8782|Inertia is often a difficult phenomenon for empiricists to measure. Observing the same behavior as in the past can simply be due to the fact that the same behavior that was optimal in the past continues to be optimal in the future. Thus, to test a theory of inertia, it is important to identify a situation in which the empiricist can measure the underlying causes that should cause an optimizer to change course. Capital structure, that is a firm's choice of financing between debt and equity, is a good candidate for testing inertia.
t0301|In this paper, we study the identification and estimation of static, discrete games of complete information. These games generalize standard discrete choice models to allow utility to also depend on the actions of other players. Examples of discrete games studied in the literature include Vuong and Bjorn (1984), Bres- nahan and Reiss (1990,1991), Berry (1992), Seim (2001), Ackerberg and Gowrisankaran (2002), Mazzeo (2002), Tamer (2002), Ciliberto and Tamer (2003), Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002), Berry, Ostrovsky and Pakes (2003), Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2003), Manuszak and Cohen (2004), Sweeting (2004) and Bajari and Krainer (2004).
w9023|The presence of a per unit transactions cost lowers the relative price of high quality goods. This point was originally made by Alchian and Allen, and was described by them more colorfully as "shipping the good apples out". That is, international transportation costs lead firms to ship high quality goods abroad while holding lower quality goods for domestic consumption. Despite considerable theoretical attention, this classical proposition has not previously been examined empirically. This paper tests the Alchian Allen conjecture using a model of trade in quality differentiated goods, and extensive data on traded goods' prices, quantities and shipping costs. We begin by modeling consumer demands for traded goods of varying quality in the presence of shipping costs. In its traditional form, the Alchian Allen hypothesis concerns the relative quality of goods shipped internationally versus domestically.
w17976|A salient feature of globalization in recent decades is the emergence of "global supply chains" in which different countries specialize in different stages of a sequential production process. In Arnaud Costinot, Jonathan Vogel and Su Wang (2011), CVW hereafter, we have developed a simple theory of trade with sequential production to shed light on how global supply chains affect the interdependence of nations. The goal of this paper is to develop a multi-factor extension of CVW to explore how the emergence of global supply chains may affect wage inequality within countries.

w9967|Modern economies experience substantial fluctuations in aggregate output and employment. In recessions, employment falls and unemployment rises. In the years immediately after a recession, the labor market is slack—unemployment remains high and the vacancy rate and other measures of employer recruiting effort are abnormally low. Unemployment is determined by the rate at which workers lose jobs and the rate at which the unemployed find jobs. I develop a model of fluctuations embodying both matching and wage frictions. The incorporation of a wage friction makes employment realistically sensitive to driving forces. My characterization of the wage friction is rather different from earlier ideas of wage rigidity and more closely integrated with the matching process.
w4041|This paper models tax competition when voters choose whether or not to reelect officials based on their performance while in office. We focus on the idea that rational voters may use neighboring jurisdictions to evaluate the performance of their incumbents. We provide both a theoretical framework to illustrate this and an empirical analysis that uses data from US states for the period 1960 --- 1989. Our starting point is a world with asymmetric information between voters and politicians --- the latter are assumed to know more about the cost of providing public services than the former. Politicians also differ in their type. Good ones do no rent seeking, whereas bad ones finance their whims at taxpayers' expense. The problem for voters is to distinguish between the two. Consonant with the large literature on multi-agent incentive schemes (see, for example, Holmstrom (1982)), we show that it makes sense for voters to appraise their incumbents relative performance. Thus if states face correlated shocks affecting the costs of providing public services, then the information gleaned from another jurisdiction's taxes is valuable for their own jurisdictions.
w9601|This paper argues that campaign finance policy, in the form of contribution limits and matching public financing, can be Pareto improving even under the most optimistic assumptions concerning the role of campaign advertising and the rationality of voters. The argument assumes that candidates use campaign contributions to convey truthful information to voters about their qualifications for office and voters update their beliefs rationally on the basis of the information they have seen. It also assumes that campaign contributions are provided by interest groups and that candidates can offer to provide policy favors for their interest groups to attract higher contributions. The argument is developed in a simple model of electoral competition.
w13833|In most countries, economic activity is spatially concentrated. While some of this concentration is explained by the presence of natural advantages that constrain specific productions to specific locations, Ellison and Glaeser (1999) and others argue that natural advantages alone cannot account for the observed degree of agglomeration. Spatial concentration is particularly remarkable for industries that produce nationally traded goods, because the areas where economic activity is concentrated are typically characterized by high costs of labor and land. Since at least Marshall (1890), economists have speculated that this concentration of economic activity may be explained by cost or productivity advantages enjoyed by firms when they locate near other firms. The list of potential sources of these agglomerations advantages includes: cheaper and faster supply of intermediate goods and services; proximity to workers or consumers; better quality of the worker-firm match in thicker labor markets; lower risk of unemployment for workers and lower risk of unfilled vacancies for firms following idiosyncratic shocks; and knowledge spillovers.1 The possibility of documenting that productivity advantages through agglomeration are real is tantalizing, because it could provide insights into a series of important questions. Why are firms that produce nationally traded goods willing to locate in cities like New York, San Francisco or London, characterized by extraordinary production costs? In general, why do cities exist and what explains their historical development? Why do income differences persist across regions and countries? Beside its obvious interest for urban and growth economists, the existence of agglomeration spillovers has tremendous practical relevance. Increasingly, local governments compete by offering substantial subsidies to industrial plants to locate within their jurisdictions. The main economic rationale for these incentives depends on whether the attraction of new businesses generates some form of agglomeration externalities. In the absence of positive externalities, it is difficult to justify the use of taxpayer money for subsidies based on efficiency grounds. The optimal magnitude of these incentives depends on the magnitude of agglomerations spillovers, if they exist.2 Despite their enormous theoretical and practical relevance, the existence and exact magnitude of agglomeration spillovers are considered open questions by many. To date, there are two primary approaches for testing for spillovers. The first tests for an unequal distribution of firms across the country. These 'dartboard' style tests reveal that firms are spread unevenly across the country and that coagglomeration rates are higher between industries that are economically similar (Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr, 2007). This approach is based on equilibrium location decisions and does not provide a direct measure of spillovers.
w4269|Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are a substantial and imperfectly understood part of the landscape of international trade. Alan Rugman (1988) estimates that the largest 500 multinationals control over one-half of global trade flows, and one-fifth of global GDP. For countries such as the US, which have a well-developed network of overseas affiliates, affiliate sales tend to swamp export flows. DeAnne Julius (1990) estimates that in markets such as Brazil and the EC, local sales by US-owned affiliates are five times the level of imports from the US. It is also striking that a large and growing share of foreign direct investment involves industrialized nations as both the source and destination markets, rather than flowing from North to South. Between 1961 and 1988, over half of all direct investment outflows generated by G-5 countries were absorbed by other G-5 countries; this share had risen to nearly 70 percent by 1988 (Julius (1990)).
w13964|The usual rationale for deterrence is closely related to the rationale behind grim trigger pun­ishment in a repeated prisoners' dilemma. Imagine two neighboring groups that repeatedly decide whether to be peaceful or to launch a surprise attack on the other. A peaceful equi­librium can only be sustained if the short run gains from a surprise attack are balanced by the long run costs of triggering conflict. The logic of deterrence is that as groups accumulate weapons, the cost of conflict increases thereby improving incentives for peaceful behavior.
w17411|In most models of democratic politics, politicians compete for votes. How politicians persuade voters to vote for them not only underpins our theories of democracy, but is central for understanding why politicians target goods towards particular groups of voters. The literature on redistributive politics has suggested several groups politicians might want to target, such as voters who are ideologically unattached, better organized, or more informed.1 These predictions, however, often arise in models in which politicians can commit to future policies or compete based on a restricted set of standard policies.2 Yet it is common around much of the world for politicians to offer goods to specific individuals before an election in exchange for their votes.3 There are at least two features that differentiate vote-buying from standard forms of re-distribution.4 First, it is not an official policy to be judged at the polls, but rather a targeted attempt to weaken electoral discipline. Thus, vote-buying could potentially undermine the desired effects of democratic constitutional arrangements.
w0905|Recent developments in U..S. monetary and fiscal affairs have led to a renewal of interest in issues reminiscent of the "Monetarist vs. Keynesian" debates of previous decades. In particular, the Council of Economic Advisers' 1982 forecast of a long string of unusually large federal budget deficits, together with the Federal Reserve's repeated avowals to keep monetary growth rates low, has conferred intense practical interest upon the question of whether bond-financed deficits have significant impact on aggregate demand and, thereby, on price level andffor output magnitudes.
w2015|Bad economic times are typically associated with a high incidence of financial distress, as measured in increased defaults, bankruptcies, and business failures, and in the general deterioration of firm balance sheets. One might argue that these financial problems are merely passive reflections of adverse developments on the real side of the economy and therefore do not require special attention. But such a view is, in our opinion, unsupportable: First, it ignores the central allocative role played by the financial system in modern capitalist economies. Second, as a matter of theory, it appears impossible to explain why we have institutions such as noncontingent debt and bankruptcy (as opposed to Arrow-Debreu contingent contracts) without invoking asymmetric information or similar factors; such considerations having been admitted, however, there is a strong presumption that they will constrain the set of equilibria attainable by the economy. Thus, financial factors should indeed " matter," ie, affect real outcomes. This paper develops a theoretical model in which financial conditions are not merely a "sideshow" to real activity but play a role in both the initiation and propagation of economic cycles.
w3515|It is no accident that the era in which European economic growth took off is called the Industrial Revolution. Blanqui [1837], first to use the phrase in print, identified its beginnings in the invention and spread of those "two machines, henceforth immortal, the steam engine and the cotton-spinning fiwater frame]." Ever since, qualitative historical discussions of growth have emphasized the role of machinery investment in augmenting labor power. Landes' [1969] statement that "the machine is at the heart of the new economic civilization" is typical of accounts that have assigned a central role to mechanization. Technology embodied in machinery has been, as Mokyr [1990] says, "the lever of riches." Yet at least until recently modem quantitative studies of economic growth have tended to downplay the role of mechanization.
w8750|Corporate investment and the stock market are positively correlated, both in the time series and in the cross-section. The traditional explanation for this relationship is that stock prices rationally reflect the marginal product of capital. This is the usual interpretation given to the relationship between investment and Tobin's Q, for example, as in Tobin (1969) and von Furstenberg (1977). Keynes (1936) suggests a very different explanation. He argues that stock prices contain an important element of irrationality. As a result, the effective cost of external equity sometimes diverges from the cost of other forms of capital.
w13878|It has long been recognized that having a press that actively covers politics is essential for democratic governance. Informed voters are better able to hold elected offcials accountable for their policy decisions, and most people get their information via the media. Frequently, however, an active press is missing from the political stage.
w15502|Unless cast in platinum and covered with diamonds, as in the case of a 2007 Damien Hirst sculpture, a work of art has little intrinsic value. Nevertheless, works of art from time to time have fetched shockingly high prices, at least from the perspective of ordinary wage earners. The highest prices have been paid for creations of deceased artists, but also living artists  Hirst being the exemplar  have commanded multi­million dollar (or pound) sums for their work. The inelastic supply in the art market makes the demand for art 'the only meaningful driver of investment returns' (Mandel, 2009).
w4158|One of the most striking features of the primary and secondary public education system in the US is the large disparity in spending per student across districts.'" As Table 1 illustrates for jurisdictions in several states, spending per pupil can vary by as much as a factor of two even across nearby communities. It is not really surprising that this is so. Given that a substantial proportion of the expenditures on public education is financed at the local level (approximately 45%), the differences in expenditures per student reflect, in large part, the realities of the US income distribution and its allocation across states and neighborhoods.
w5430|According to the 1994 Statistical Abstract of the United States, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) have 18% more crime than other American cities and 200% more crime than rural areas.1 For violent crimes, MSAs have 79% more crime than urban areas not in MSAs and almost 300% more crime than rural areas. New York and Los Angeles have crime rates that are approximately four times higher than the crime rates of metropolitan statistical areas as a whole and have violent crime rates that are more than 2.5 times the violent crime rates of all MSAs.
w1182|This paper specifies and estimates a four-equation disequilibrium model of the consumption goods market in a centrally planned economy (CPE). The data are from Poland for the period 1955-1980, but the analysis is more general and will be applied to other CPEs as soon as the appropriate data sets are complete. The work reported here is based on the previous papers of Portes and Winter (1980) and Charemza and Quandt (1982), referred to below as P-W and C-Q.
w11825|For most of history soldiers captured by the enemy were either slaughtered or enslaved to die quickly in a mine or galley ship or other lethal place. The concept of prisoners of war developed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries both because of Enlightenment ideas and because the mercenaries widely used by seventeenth century armies sought to save their own lives. During the Napoleonic Wars, the first to employ mass conscription, captured troops were often kept in prison camps and later exchanged. The first total war, the American Civil War, saw the first formal code of conduct for dealing with prisoners of war, drawn up in 1863 at President Lincoln’s request.
w2708|Virtually every country that experienced rapid growth of productivity and living standards over the last 200 years has done so by industrializing. Countries that have successfully industrialized---turned to production of manufactures taking advantage of scale economies---are the ones that grew rich, be they 18th-century Britain or 20th-century Korea and Japan. Yet despite the evident gains from industrialization, and the success of many countries in achieving it, numerous other countries remain unindustrialized and poor. What is it that allows some but not other countries to industrialize? And can government intervention accelerate the process? Of the many causes of lack of growth of underdeveloped countries, a particularly important and frequently discussed constraint on industrialization is the small size of the domestic market.
w3062|The problem of optimal public enforcement of law -- the problem of selecting probabilities and magnitudes of sanctions that best deter violations -- is examined here in a model in which two types of enforcement effort, specific and general, are distinguished. By specific enforcement effort. I mean activity devoted to apprehending and penalizing individuals who have committed a single type of harmful act. The activity of an employee of a traffic department whose sole duty is to ticket people for overtime parking exemplifies specific enforcement effort; so does, typically, investigative or prosecutorial effort made after the commission of a harmful act, for such effort by its nature concerns a single act. In contrast, general enforcement effort is activity affecting the likelihood of apprehension of individuals who have committed any of a range of harmful acts. A policeman on the beat, for instance, is able to apprehend many types of violators of law, from those who shoplift, to those who engage in assault, to those who commit murder. Whenever an enforcement agent's activity naturally allows him to detect different types of violators, the i enforcement activity is what is called here general.
w4715|Over 35 percent of Argentina's population is concentrated in Buenos Aires, a city of 12 million inhabitants. What is it about countries such as Argentina, Japan and Mexico that justifies their urban concentration when die United States' largest city contains only 6 percent of its population? We investigate the causes of urban primacy using evidence from a cross-section of 85 modern countries and five case studies (classical Rome, 1650 London, 1700 Edo, Buenos Aires in 1900 and Mexico City today). We find that concentration in the nation's largest city falls with total population and with the share of labor employed in agriculture. As predicted by Kwgman and Livas [1992], countries with high shares of trade in GDP, or low tariff barriers (even holding trade levels constant), rarely have their population concentrated in a single city. Urban centralization also foils with the development of transportation networks. But political forces, even more than economic factors, drive urban centralization: dictatorships cause concentration in a single metropolis.
w15049|In the popular press and much of the business community it continues to be an article of faith that 'consumer confidence' has an important role  both prognostic and causal  in macroeconomics. On the other hand, the stance of the rather limited academic literature on confidence is far more ambiguous. The judgments range from the conclusion that confidence measures have an important role both in prediction and understanding the cause of business cycles, to the view that they contain important information but have little role in the assignment of causality, to the verdict that they have no value even in forecasting. There are, broadly speaking, two contrasting approaches to the role of confidence in macroeconomics. The first, which we will refer to as the 'animal spirits' view, posits autonomous fluctuations in beliefs and consumption that in turn have causal effects on economic activity. In the proceedings of a symposium on the causes of the 1990-1991 recession, both Hall (1993) and Blanchard (1993) regard exogenous movements in consumption as a cause of business cycles.1 Indeed, Blanchard proposes that the cause of the recession was a powerful, long-lasting negative consumption shock associated with an exogenous shift in pessimism that had a causal effect on consumption and overall aggregate demand. While not fully pursuing the idea in his brief paper, Blanchard proposes that one might be able to test this hypothesis on the basis of the observation that such an exogenous shift in pessimism ought to have only temporary effects on consumption.2 The second view of confidence  what we will call the 'information view'  suggests that a relationship between innovations in measures of consumer confidence and subsequent macroeconomic activity arises because confidence measures contain fundamental information about the current and future states of the economy. For example, Cochrane (1994b) proposes that consumption surprises proxy for news that consumers receive about future productivity that does not otherwise show up in econometricians' information sets. His attempt to reconcile VAR evidence with theory closely anticipates the 'news approach to business cycles' of Beaudry and Portier (2004, 2006). They analyze models where agents become aware of changes in future productivity orthogonal to current productivity, and argue that stock price innovations proxy for future technological improvement not reflected in current technology. The 'information view' of confidence supposes that confidence innovations might contain similar information. 1 In an interesting but almost forgotten early contribution, Hall (1986)  partially repudiating Hall (1978)  argues that an important fraction of the random walk in consumption comes not from the expectational surprise in the Euler equation but from a second disturbance that he has more recently referred to as 'spontaneous consumption'.
w12334|In response to a recent antitrust lawsuit against the National Residency Matching Program, Bulow and Levin (forthcoming) show that when firms set impersonal salaries simultaneously, before matching with workers, then such a match leads to lower aggregate wages compared to any competitive outcome. Crawford (forthcoming) shows that this concern can be addressed by incorporating ﬂexible salaries in the centralized match, that is, the possibility for each position to have more than one potential salary, with the final salary to be determined together with the worker-firm pairing. This builds on earlier work that shows that a match in which each position can have a large number of contracts, which I will call a multiple contract match, allows for competitive outcomes (Crawford and Knoer 1981; Kelso and Crawford, 1982, Roth 1984b, and see also, Hatfield and Milgrom 2005).
w4244|Economists have proposed numerous theories designed to explain corporate dividend policy. Different views about dividend policy lead to strikingly different conclusions about issues such as the cost of capital and the effects of tax policy. It is, therefore, important to distinguish between these theories on the basis of empirical evidence. Unfortunately, this task has proven difficult. In an attempt to test various theories of corporate dividend policy, Poterba and Summers [1983, 1984, 1985] assembled evidence on the relative market value of dividends and capital gains, the effect of dividend taxation on dividend payout, and the effect of dividend taxation on investment. Their evaluation of this evidence was favorable to a "traditional view" of dividends, in which firms derive an advantage from the payment of dividends, and where this advantage is reflected in market value.
w7158|Small-group decisions are ubiquitous for decisions under uncertainty. Judgment by a jury of one's peers, not by a single person, is the hallmark of the American criminal justice system. Committees recommend hiring and tenure decisions, are essential for project and investment undertakings in business firms, and are used for many administrative decisions in all organizations. Group evaluations bring different points of view to bear on a question. They allow the pooling of information that is not otherwise available to a single decision-maker. But conflict among committee members limits the possibilities for information pooling.
w3989|For the last twenty years an important goal of financial research has been to generalize the insights of the simple one-period Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to a multi-period setting. Such a generalization is difficult to achieve because the multi-period consumption and portfolio choice problem is inherently nonlinear. A complete solution is obtained by combining the consumer's Euler equation with the intertemporal budget constraint, but the budget constraint is a nonlinear equation except in very special cases. In response to this difficulty Merton (1969, 1971, 1973) suggested reformulating the consumption and portfolio choice problem in continuous time. Doing this in effect linearizes by taking the decision interval as infinitely small, so that the model becomes linear over this interval. But this kind of linearity is only local, so it does not allow one easily to study longer-run aspects of intertemporal asset pricing theory. In this paper I take a different approach. Instead of assuming that the time interval is small, I assume that variation in the consumption-wealth ratio is small.
w7805|I encourage potential readers of this paper to first put it down for two minutes and thumb through a thirty- or forty-year-old issue of an economics journal. I anticipate that this will convey much better than I can how dramatically economics papers have changed over the last few decades. Papers today are much longer.1 They have longer introductions.2 They have more sections discussing extensions of the main results. They have more references.3 The process by which papers get published has also changed dramatically. Around 1960 the Quarterly Journal of Economics reserved the "revise-and-resubmit" option for five or so special cases per year.
t0276|Diffusion models, and their extensions such as jump-diffusions and Markov models driven by LØvy processes, are essential tools for much of theoretical asset pricing. Estimating these models from discrete time observations has become in recent years an active area of research in econometrics and statistics. Beyond the choice of inference strategy, an important debate in this area concerns the question of what sampling scheme to use, if a choice is available, and in any event what to do with the sampling times. The most straightforward thing to do, in accordance with the usual low-frequency data collection procedures in finance, is to view the sampling as occurring at fixed discrete time intervals, such as a day or a week. In many circumstances, however, this is not realistic.
w2850|Investment in highly indebted countries (HICs) has fallen dramatically in this decade, from 25.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1980 to 17.2 percent in 1984, rebounding only to 19.6 percent in 1987. 1 Over the same period, net capital flows have sharply reversed so that most HICs are now making interest payments in excess of new borrowing. Given their failure to grow over the past decade, there is now a widespread view that the HICs will never pay their debts in full; HIC bank loans trade in the secondary market at large discounts to par. 2 Recently, many countries have tried to alleviate their debt burdens either by repurchasing part of their debt at discount or by engaging in debt-equity swaps. Mexico, Chile, and Bolivia have already conducted debt repurchases, and Costa Rica is considering one. Debt-equity swaps have been tried to varying degrees by most of the major debtor countries. In a debt-equity swap, a foreign investor purchases debt on the secondary market and swaps it with the debtor country in exchange for direct foreign investment (that is, physical investment in the debtor country). Using swaps, Brazil may have cut its $120 billion foreign debt by as much as $6 billion in 198S alone. Chile has retired $4.2 billion through swaps and other mechanisms since the end of 1984, reducing its bank debt outstanding by more than 36 percent.
w10132|The ability to attract external financing is crucial for the creation of new firms and the expansion of existing ones. For that reason the nature of the financial arrangements between investors and entrepreneurs has important consequences for the growth of firms. One important issue in financial con- tracting is enforceability, that is, the ability of each side to repudiate the contract. This is especially important because projects often involve specific entrepreneurial expertise and might be worth less to investors without the services of managers who initiated them. At the same time the development of such projects may provide managers with experience that is extremely valuable for starting new projects. Contractual arrangements that are motivated by limited enforceability are most likely to be important for firms that are small, young and invest in assets that cannot be used as collateral. Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (1997) have shown that these considerations can help to explain some of the growth characteristics of small and young firms.
w6606|Recent events in Asia must have convinced anyone who still needed convincing that financial crises in emerging markets must be a major priority for research in economics. Economies that until recently had been hailed as paragons of good macroeconomic management suddenly find themselves mired in a massive collapse of asset prices and economic activity. This situation is unprecedented in scope, but not kind. Other financial melt downs, particularly in Chile in 1982 and in Mexico in 1994, were just as surprising to observers and just as difficult to rationalize using standard models.1 A model that provides a useful formalization of this phenomenon must have the following features: 1. It must not rely on government misbehavior to generate the crisis.
w7864|Over the past ten to fifteen years, OECD governments have taken enormous strides in mitigating the "commitment" problem in monetary policy and, as a result, world-wide inflation rates have dropped dramatically. Nowadays, academic discussions of optimal monetary policy increasingly focus on old-fashioned stabilization considerations, rather than anti-inflation credibility.1 The international dimensions of monetary stabilization, however, have largely been ignored. Is it a problem that countries design their rule-based domestic monetary institutions unilaterally, ignoring international spillover effects? Is it possible that the current system produces, say, excessive attention to inflation stabilization and inadequate attention to output stabilization, when viewed from a global perspective? We are not the first to address this question.
w0756|The validity of the permanent income-life cycle hypothesis (PIH) as an explanation of consumer spending is an important issue in macroeconomics.1 Since this hypothesis was posed (separately) by Friedman 2 (1957) and by Modigliani , it has been frequently put to empirical 3 test. Evidence both pro and con has been advanced. Recently, this question has been illuminated by the realization that the hypothesis of rational expectations, in conjunction with the PIH, imposes strong restrictions on the stochastic properties of consumption conditional on income. In pioneering articles, Hall (1978) and Sargent (1978) used these restrictions to test the joint rational expectations - permanent income hypothesis in the US time series data. Flavin (forthcoming) has shown that, properly interpreted, the Hall and Sargent papers concur in rejecting the joint hypothesis. Noting the relatively low power of time series tests, Hall and Mishkin (forthcoming) followed by applying these methods (and several 4 innovations) in panel data. The results of their analysis of the relation of food consumption to income change were ambiguous; the PIH could not be clearly accepted or rejected. One feature of this recent research has been the small amount of attention paid to the durables component of consumer expenditure: Of the papers mentioned, only Sargent's does not completely eliminate durables from the measure of consumption. The reason for this neglect is that the theory, as developed, is a predictor of actual consumption; what is observed, however, is not consumption but expenditure.
w9295|The descriptive accounts of the media industry (Mencken 1975, Goldberg 2002), as well as journalism textbooks (Jamieson and Campbell 2002) recognize that media outlets do not just report plain facts. One commonly noted bias in reporting is ideological. During President Clinton's impeachment trial, the right-leaning media supported impeachment, arguing that even a small lie in a civil deposition constitutes a major crime. The left-leaning media, in contrast, saw the trial as a witch-hunt, treating the very same violations condemned by the conservative press as trivial. Another, perhaps less commonly noted, bias is not ideological at all, but rather results from the need to tell a memorable story. Thus both the conservative and the liberal media condemned Wen Ho Lee as a Chinese spy, without entertaining the possibility that he was scape-goated by dishonest officials. The media were surely biased, and probably wrong. In this paper, we draw a sharp analytical distinction between these two kinds of biased reporting. We call the traditional left or right bias ideology, and the less traditional bias - one based on the need to tell a story - spin. We see ideology as coming directly from the preferences of either editors or reporters. For example, left wing newspapers may simply prefer to report news one way.
w8203|Like other countries that rely on the income tax as a source of revenue, the United States distinguishes between corporations and individuals. US corporations and individuals face separate tax schedules and different rules regarding income and deductions. Under this classical system of corporate taxation, there is limited coordination, or integration, of the two tax systems: taxes on shareholders are assessed independently of the taxes on the corporations they own. By contrast, many other countries have attempted to effect some form of integration of corporate and individual income taxes. However, even in these countries, adjustments have taken the form of partial measures, leaving the corporation income tax with independent effects. Through the years, economists have devoted considerable effort to understanding the incidence of a distinct corporation income tax and its impact on the investment and financial decisions of firms.
w4163|In his celebrated treatise on the "leisure class," Thorstein Veblen [1899] argued that wealthy individuals often consume highly conspicuous goods and services in order to advertise their wealth, thereby achieving greater social status. Veblen's writings have spawned a significant body of research on "prestige" or "status" goods.1 It is readily apparent that the desire for prestige continues to influence the demand for certain consumer products. The automobile industry provides several examples. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal noted that "a BMW in every driveway might thrill investors in the short run but ultimately could dissipate the prestige that lures buyers to these luxury cars" (Aeppel [1992]). In contrast, Suburu attempts to combat the prestige factor; its recent advertisements suggest that "if your car improves your standing with your neighbors then you live among snobs.
w5816|One measure of progress in empirical econometrics is the frequency of data used. Upon entering Graduate School, I learned that my thesis supervisor, TC Liu, had just broken the sound barrier by estimating the first quarterly model of the US economy in Liu(1964). Shortly thereafter, he doubled the feat by publishing a monthly macro model, Liu(1969) I've not yet seen a weekly model of the macroeconomy but I suspect there may be some in both government and private sector research groups. In finance a similar transition has lead from the analysis of annual data to monthly data, to weekly data, to daily data and now there is great interest in intradaily models. In each case, much of the movement to higher frequency econometrics was a consequence of the availablility of higher frequency measurements of the economy. It is natural to suppose that this will continue and we will have ever increasing frequencies of observations. However, a moment's reflection will reveal that this is not the case. The limit in nearly all cases, is achieved when all transactions are recorded.
w4389|This paper is about testing a relatively new theory of international trade. The life cycle of trade theories seems to progress as follows. First, some brilliant theorists, say Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin (1991 translation), arrive at a new theory explaining international trade flows. After a while, someone comes along, say Wassily Leontief (1953). and tests the theory, finds that it doesn't do exceptionally well, and leaves matters generally mucked up. Later, someone else, say Edward Learner (1984, 1987). comes along and sets matters straight Maybe the theory works, maybe it does not, but by the time Learner was done, trade economists more or less knew why the theory did or did not find support in the data If those are the three steps in the life cycle of international trade theories, this paper is part of the second stage. This time around the theory tested is that of monopolistic competition and international trade. Instead of Heckscher and Ohlin, we have Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman. In this paper, we point out some puzzles and paradoxes. We do not provide many answers. At best, we pave the way for the third stage of the theory's life cycle. At worst, we leave matters confused and unsettled. Uiere is a long and distinguished literature examining the theory of international trade and monopolistic competition. The first papers were by Krugman (1979 and 1981) and Lancaster(19S0).
w4264|This paper develops new techniques for empirically analyzing demand and supply in differentiated products markets and then applies these techniques to analyze equilibrium in the US automobile industry. Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a broad class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the US automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period. On the cost side, we estimate cost as a function of product characteristics. On the demand side, we estimate own- and cross-price elasticities as well as elasticities of demand with respect to vehicle attributes (such as weight or fuel efficiency.) These elasticities play crucial roles in the analysis of the likely effects of various policies.
w2009|The dynamic impact of fiscal policy is a central issue in macroeconomics. One outstanding puzzle regards the interaction between government purchases and real interest rates. Standard neoclassical analysis, as presented by Barro [1984] for example, implies that permanent increases in government purchases should not affect real interest rates while temporary increases in government purchases should increase real interest rates. Data for the United States, however, provide no support for this prediction. Wars are the classic example. As Barro [1984, pp. 315-316] documents, wars are not associated with high real interest rates. To the extent any systematic effect is present in US data, real interest rates appear lower during wars. In this paper I study an extention of the standard infinite horizon neoclassical growth model and propose an explanation for this apparent anomaly. My analysis is in the spirit of much recent work that examines the dynamic effects of fiscal policy in neoclassical models.2 Most previous studies, however, do not explicitly include consumer durable goods. Introducing consumer durable goods is a natural way of modifying the consumer's utility function so that it is not separable through time.3 Alternatively, one can view consumer durable goods as being another use of accumulated wealth. I show that a simple neoclassical model incorporating a non-durable consumer good, a durable consumer good, and a durable producer good generates -2- a perhaps surprising dynamic response to changes in government purchases.
w4788|The economic significance of transactions that transfer corporate control is now widely recognized. This paper focuses on an important set of control-shifting transactions---those in which a controlling interest in a corporation is sold from one party to another. These "sale-of-control" transactions are different from the tender offer acquisitions which have attracted much attention in the last decade. Tender offers or takeover bids are used when ownership of the target company is dispersed, with no shareholder holding a controlling interest. However, in many publicly traded corporations - both in the United States and (even more so) in other countries---a significant number of shares are concentrated in the hands of a controlling shareholder.1 In such cases, a buyer generally cannot obtain control unless the existing controller agrees to sell some or all of its shares to the buyer in a sale-of-control transaction.
w8464|Human capital investments are risky. Complementarities among skills, both in how they are learned and how they are used, imply that an efficient human capital portfolio consists of skills whose values are highly positively correlated. One of the main risks with which owners of human capital must contend is technological obsolescence. Best practice methodology is always evolving, and may do so in ways that preserve the value of some skills while depreciating others dramatically. Architecture is a good example of the latter.1 Advances in computing have revolutionized the field, increasing the art component in what had traditionally been a blend of art, engineering and drafting. This lowered the cost of design development drastically, and altered the cost of experimentation or modification of plans even more. Older architects have found it uneconomic to master the complex computer skills that enable the young to produce architectural services so easily and flexibly, and have found hiring a "computer department" to be a poor substitute.
w2547|This paper analyzes strategic communication in equilibrium models of conventional and final-offer interest arbitration. Both models emphasize the role of learning by the arbitrator from the parties' offers about the state of the employment relationship, which is known to the parties but not to the arbitrator. In both models, the arbitrator's equilibrium behavior is identical to the reduced-form decision rule typically assumed in the empirical literature (namely, a weighted average of the parties' offers and a settlement motivated by the publicly observable facts of the case). The paper thereby provides a structural interpretation for the existing empirical work.
w4271|This paper presents new empirical evidence that expansionary monetary policy shocks generate substantial, persistent depreciations in US nominal and real exchange rates. Our analysis builds on work by Stockman (1983), Mussa (1986), Baxter and Stockman (1989), Backus and Kehoe (1992) and Meltzer (1992) who have documented key features of international business cycles. Unlike these authors, we do not focus on unconditional correlations. Instead, we ask how interest rates and exchange rates (nominal and real) respond to a specific impulse, namely a shock to monetary policy. We focus on conditional correlations because of the difficulty of interpreting unconditional correlations in environments where agents are subject to multiple sources of uncertainty.
w2425|Macroeconomists are generally concerned with characterizing the positive and normative aspects of business cycles. Two important features of cycles are: (i) correlated movements in aggregate output over time and (ii) the positive co-movement in output and employment between sectors over the cycle. Discussions of these observations appear, for example, in Lucas [1977], Long-Plosser [1983], Zarnowitz [1985].1 For the purpose of building models of the cycle, the task is to determine the features of preferences, endowments, technology and information, along with the institutional structure in which agents interact, that reproduce these two key observations. Macroeconomic theorists (see, for example, Kydland-Prescott [1982]) have focused on correlated movements in output over time by studying the wide variety of intertemporal linkages (capital, non-separable preferences, stochastic structure) present in the economy.
w3728|This paper measures the heterogeneity of establishment-level employment changes in the US manufacturing sector over the 1972 to 1986 period. We measure this heterogeneity in terms of the gross creation and destruction of jobs and the rate at which jobs are reallocated across plants. Our measurement efforts enable us to quantify the connection between job reallocation and worker reallocation, to evaluate theories of heterogeneity in plant-level employment dynamics, and to establish new results related to the cyclical behavior of the labor market. Our empirical work exploits a tremendously rich data set with approximately 860,000 annual observations on 160,000 manufacturing establishments. The data are longitudinal and include observations on all manufacturing establishments sampled in the Annual Survey of Manufactures between 1972 and 1986. The combination of establishment-level longitudinal data, high frequency observations, a fifteen-year sample, and comprehensive coverage of the manufacturing sector provides an excellent basis for developing the implications of heterogeneity in establishment-level employment dynamics. A key aspect of our study is its focus on gross job flows as opposed to gross worker flows. Previous studies have documented the tremendous gross worker flows across labor market states (ie, employment, unemployment, out of the labor force) and high worker turnover rates.
w19810|The theoretical result that there are gains from trade is a central tenet of international economics. Assuming perfect competition and no market failures, trade acts like a technological improvement that expands the set of feasible allocations and enables Pareto superior outcomes to be achieved. A recent body of research has sought to quantify the magnitude of these welfare gains.
w4614|Simple models of business cycles based on aggregate demand shocks imply that during booms, factor prices should fall relative to output prices. This follows from the standard assumption that, at high output levels, marginal products are low. However, this implication is difficult to square with the facts. During booms, wages and raw-materials prices tend to rise relative to output prices --- that is, real factor prices are procyclical.1 A number of papers have argued that imperfect competition can reconcile procyclical real factor prices with aggregate-demand-driven business cycles.
w5033|In the standard model of the family, all members of the family jointly maximize a common objective function. This is because members are altruistic to each other, or because of the Rotten Kid Theorem of Becker (1991) that selfish members find it to their self interest to subscribe to the altruist's objective. The model has the strong neutrality implication that the family's demand for each commodity is invariant to the division of resources within the family as long as total family resources are controlled for. The existing literature has examined this demand neutrality with respect to the division of resources between the husband and wife.1 The purpose of this paper is to test inter-generational altruism by studying the division of resources between the parent and adult child. As in Bourguignon et. al. (1991a,b), we test demand neutrality by estimating Engel curves on cross-section data. The advantage of the use of Engel curves is that the effect of the family's total resources on demand is accounted for by total expenditure. The data we use came from a random cross-section sample of Japanese households.
w4550|Changes in fertility have long been recognized as important correlates of economic growth. Indeed, the relationship between the level of fertility and the level of income per capita is one of the strongest observable correlations in cross country data. The nature of the relationship between development and fertility has been studied from the perspective of the theory of growth as well as from the perspective of family economics. Growth theory has focussed on the negative effect of population growth on the level of capital per worker, and thus on the level of output per worker, whereas family economics has focussed on the changes in the economic environment that lead families to reduce fertility as countries become wealthier. This paper integrates these two strains of literature. It combines a model of the household's fertilityfflabor supply choice with a growth model in which the wages of men and women are endogenously determined. The main concern of the study is with how growth, via changes in relative factor prices, affects household decisions about the level of fertility and women's labor force participation, and how these decisions in turn feed back through the aggregate production mechanism to affect output growth. The analysis demonstrates that the effects of growth on fertility and of fertility on growth are mutually reenforcing.
w3294|The idea that wages rise relative to alternatives over the duration of a job is the foundation for several important theories of productivity and compensation. Most prominently, a key prediction of Becker's (1964) model of investment in specific human capital is that wages rise with job tenure (seniority), leaving workers with a stake in the specific value of the employment relationship. Related theories of agency in durable employment relations (Becker and Stigler, 1974; Lazear, 1981) also generate deferred compensation that encourages workers' effort and improves performance.
w7333|This paper considers the definition and identification of causal parameters in economics and their role in econometric policy analysis. It assesses different research programs designed to recover causal parameters from data. At the beginning of this century, economic theory was mainly intuitive and empirical support for it was largely anecdotal. At the end of the century, economics has a rich array of formal models and a high-quality data base. Empirical regularities motivate theory in many areas of economics and data are routinely used to test theory. Many economic theories have been developed as measurement frameworks to suggest what data should be collected and how they should be interpreted. Econometric theory was developed to analyze and interpret economic data. Most econometric theory adapts methods originally developed in statistics.
w3491|The importance of sectoral reallocation as a source of aggregate unemployment is the subject of ongoing debate. While KeyneBian explanations of unemployment have tended to emphasize aggregate disturbances as the cause of business cycles, many real business cycle theories attribute unemployment primarily to sectoral shocks that are propagated through imperfect labor market adjustment.' Indeed, some economists have argued that sectoral shifts were primarily responsible for the high levels of unemployment in the US in the 1970'a and 1980's, although the empirical evidence is by no means conclusive.2 The debate over the causes of unemployment persists in large part because it is difficult to distinguish empirically between unemployment associated with reallocation versus aggregate shocks.3 An increase in unemployment may reflect a contraction in aggregate demand that causes firms in all sectors to lay off workers temporarily.
w16718|Recent studies provide evidence that a significant portion of the cross-country variation in female labor force participation and fertility can be explained by cultural norms.1 In a recent paper, we examine the historical origins of these cultural differences (see Alberto Alesina, Paola Giuliano and Nathan Nunn, 2010). We test the long-standing hypothesis, first developed by Ester Boserup (1970), that different attitudes about gender roles evolved because of differences in the form of agriculture traditionally practiced. In societies with shifting cultivation, agriculture is labor intensive, cultivation uses a hoe or a digging stick, and women actively participate. In contrast, with intensive cultivation, which uses the plough, agricultural work requires significant strength. In these societies men tend to specialize in agriculture and women tend to specialize in home production and other work within the domestic sphere.
w7695|As people get richer they consume not only more goods but better goods. Quantifying such quality growth is difficult. Because of exacting data requirements, the hedonic techniques pioneered by Griliches (1961) and Adelman and Griliches (1961) are still only applied to a limited number of goods (eg, cars, houses, computers). Shapiro and Wilcox (1996, p. 124) describe the measurement of quality change as necessitating "house-to-house combat", ie, detailed good-by-good studies. The Boskin Commission (1996) cites only a handful of studies in arriving at its estimate that unmeasured quality change biases the US CPI upward by about 0.6% per year.
w10234|In a classic paper, Demsetz (1967) argues that the creation of institutions is shaped by demand. Introducing an institution only becomes efficient when the scale of an activity it supports becomes significant enough to cover the costs of creating and running it. Using the example of Indians in the Quebec region circa 1700, Demsetz maintains that the aggregate value of fur trading explains the emergence of enforced land ownership rights. In this paper, we show that Demsetz’s logic is quite general theoretically but also valid empirically.
w7684|In this paper, we shall study the post-war behavior of the US stock market. We shall argue that a major technological innovation causes the stock market to be temporarily undervalued until the claims to future dividends enter the stock market via initial public offerings. In other words, that aggregate capitalization fell below the present value of dividends because a chunk of the dividend-yielding capital stock was missing from the stock market. Capital is likely to "disappear" during epochs of major technological change $ especially at the beginning of such epochs, because this is when new capital forms in small, private companies.
w2613|In recent years, Robert Barro's [1974] version of "Ricardian equivalence" has stimulated much controversy concerning the effects of government budget deficits and social security programs. In his well-known paper, Barro supplemented the traditional overlapping generations model with intergenerational altruism, and argued, in essence, that voluntary transfers between parents and children cause the representative family to behave as though it is a single, infinite-lived individual---a "dynastic" unit. From the point of view of the family, neither debt nor social security alters available alternatives; both are therefore neutral. Thus, Barro's analysis identifies the strength of intergenerational altruism as a key factor in determining the effects of governEKnt bond issues and public pension programs. Recently, Bernheim and Bagwell [1988] have argued against the applicability of Ricardian equivalence by demonstrating that Barro's assumptions guarantee the irrelevance of all redistributional policies, distortionary taxes, and prices---the neutrality of fiscal policy is only the "tip of the iceburg.
w2318|Given tastes and productive technologies, is there some sense in which general financial conditions (eg, financial "stability") exert an independent effect on the macroeconomy? Policy-makers appear to think so: Concerns about financial stability are a principal motivation for regulation of banking and securities markets and are a factor in monetary policy. Applied macroeconomists, also, have stressed the role of financial conditions (specifically in most cases, the state of aggregate and sectoral balance sheets) in the propagation of aggregate fluctuations. In the DRI model, for example, procyclical movements in the ratio of net worth to liabilities of borrowers feed back into the determination of real activity; Eckstein and Sinai (1986) claim that this mechanism is in fact important for explaining the volatility of output.
w11525|This paper is concerned with the effects of antitrust policy in markets in which innovation is important. Traditionally, antitrust analyses have largely ignored issues of innovation, focusing instead on the priceffoutput effects of contested practices.1 Yet, over the last two decades, intellectual property and innovation have become central to competition in a large share of the economy. In the wake of these changes, and sparked by the recent Microsoft case, a number of commentators have expressed concerns that traditional antitrust analysis might be poorly suited to maximizing welfare in such industries.
t0083|Let y, t—l I be a n-dimensional cointegrated stochastic process. In theory, the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the unknown coefficients of the cointegrating vectors can be found by parameterizing the covariance matrix of (y1 y1) and directly computing the Gaussian likelihood. In practice, however, this entails inverting the nTxnl covariance matrix and so is computationally impractical. This has led various researchers to compute the MLE using factorizations of the likelihood that reduce computational demands, typically to the level of nonlinear simultaneous equations regression. Research so far has focused on the case that each element of y individually is integrated of order 1 (is 1(1)), typically with no drift term. Johansen (1988) and Akin and Reinsel (1987) independently derived the asymptotic distribution of the MLZ when the cointegrated system is parameterized as a vector error correction model, and Johansen (1989) extended this result to the case of nonzero drifts. Phillips (l988a) derived asymptotic representations for MLE's in a cointegrated ARMA model.
w6457|In terms of the sheer scope of economic, social and political change, few events rival the transition from planning to markets now under way in eastern Europe. The macroeconomic impact of the transition has been dramatic: output levels collapsed by between forty and fifty percent in most countries before staging a modest recovery in the last two years. These dramatic changes in aggregate economic activity yield a promising background for understanding consumption and savings during the transition. Some progress has been made in this direction on the aggregate level1, yet little is known as yet about the savings behavior of households in transition economies. In this paper, we employ household surveys conducted by the World Bank in three central European economies, Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland to explore household savings choices during the transition.
w2514|General equilibrium analysis of labor unions has taken place primarily within the context of closed- or small-open-economy versions of the two-sector neoclassical model. The early contributions to this literature introduce an exogenous union wage premium in one sector and consider the implications for various properties of the general equilibrium. Several recent papers have made endogenous the actions of the labor union in an effort to understand both the way unions respond to changing international conditions and the implications of union 2ff behavior for broader comparative statics results. What has not been considered formally is the effect of union activity on the international location of production and the pattern of international trade: that is, the simultaneous determination of the union wage and the set of products produced by union workers. By modeling the union as operating in an import-competing sector that produces a variety of heterogeneous goods, this paper explores the union's impact on the pattern of trade and, at the same time, the effect on union wages of shifting international patterns of production. In particular, if goods within the union sector differ in the intensity with which they require union labor, and if the (domestic) union wage premium is an important source of international cost differences, then only the least labor-intensive range of union-sector goods will be produced domestically, with goods of greatest labor intensity being produced abroad as a result of the relatively high cost of domestic union labor.
w12994|This paper characterizes the relationship between consumption and income variability in a class of private information models with asset accumulation and uses this characterization to derive some of their empirical implications. Interest in these models is partly motivated by the empirical rejection of simpler approaches, including the hypothesis of complete insurance markets and models where the only insurance available to agents is self insurance, such as simple versions of the life cycleff permanent income hypothesis. Our approach enables us to interpret some of the results in the literature (and those we present below) as providing evidence on the market structure facing economic agents.
w3822|A commonly observed feature of law enforcement is what we shall call self-reporting of behavior -- the reporting by parties of their own harm-producing actions to an enforcement authority. For example, firms frequently report on their behavior In the context of environmental and safety regulation, Individuals Involved In accidents causing Injury to others often report this to the police, and even those who commit crimes sometimes confess their acts to the authorities. Presumably, parties voluntarily report on their behavior because they fear more severe treatment If they do not.1 What are the social advantages of self-reporting that may help to explain Its use In law enforcement? More broadly, how does self- reporting fit In the theory of the control of harmful externalities? The literature on controlling externalities, dating from Plgou (1918), suggests that activities that create harm be taxed, but does not emphasize the costs of Identifying parties who cause harm. The more recent literature on law enforcement, however, Investigates the control of harmful activities when It Is costly to Identify the parties responsible for causing harm.
w2792|Virtually every country that taxes income imposes a capital gains tax only upon the realization of gains rather than on accrual. Though countries vary with respect to indexing for inflation and the relative tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income, the realization-based tax system sets capital gains taxation apart from other forms of taxation and is associated with a variety of economic distortions. The most frequently discussed problem arising from taxing capital gains upon realization is the "lock-in" effect, the desire to hold appreciated assets in order to defer taxes on gains already accrued. This effect leads investors to accept a lower rate of return before-tax than they would for new investments without such accrued gains, resulting in a distorted allocation of capital and inefficient portfolio selection. As an illustration of the lock-in effect, consider a simple two-period example in which an investor, having accrued a first-period gain, g, must decide whether to realize the gain and reinvest at the safe rate of return, i, or hold the asset for an additional, safe rate of return r.
w0677|This paper provides quantitative estimates of the output, price, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among a number of countries. The econometric model that is used for this purpose is described in Fair (1981), and the present paper is an extension of this work. The linkages are examined by changing various policy variables in the model and observing the resulting changes in the endogenous variables. The results of ten experiments are reported.
w4093|Standard models of international asset trade lack mechanisms linking an economy's long-run output growth rate to its financial openness. Within such models the gains from asset trade, at least between industrial economies, typically are estimated to be quite modest under common specifications of individuals' preferences.1 The contribution of this paper is a simple model of global portfolio diversification in which a link between growth and financial openness emerges very naturally. Within this model, an economy that opens its asset markets to trade may experience an increase in expected consumption growth and a substantial rise in national welfare. Recent analyses of economic growth due to Romer (1986, 1990), Lucas (1988), and others explore mechanisms through which growth rates are endogenously determined by technological parameters, intertemporal preferences, market structures, and government policies. Extensions of these mechanisms to multi-economy frameworks, notably those contained in the treatise by Grossman and Helpman (1991), show that international trade in goods may accelerate or slow growth by shifting resources among alternative productive uses. The model set out below pursues this line of approach, showing that a pure expansion of opportunities for trade across states of nature may itself promote resource reallocations favorable to long-term economic growth.
w7847|This paper is a statistical analysis of the manner in which the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) determines the level of short-term interest rates in the US. In particular, we study when and how the Fed decides to change the level of the Federal funds rate target, one of the most publicized and anticipated indicators for financial markets all over the world. The target (for short) is an internal objective that is unilaterally set by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System in compliance with the directives agreed upon at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. The target is used by the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a guide for the daily conduct of open market operations.
w8272|The laws of many countries in the world originate in those of England and France. Legal systems based on the laws of England are typically described as belonging to the common law tradition, while those based on the laws of France as belonging to the civil, or Roman, law tradition1. Structurally, the two legal systems operate in very different ways: civil law relies on professional judges, legal codes, and written records, while common law on lay judges, broader legal principles, and oral arguments.
w12618|The goal of this paper is to develop a test for the optimal level of unemployment insurance using a minimal amount of economic theory and a minimal amount of data. We approach this by studying a risk-averse worker in a sequential job search setting (McCall, 1970). Our main theoretical insight is that the worker's after-tax reservation wage---the difference between her reservation wage and the tax needed to fund the unemployment insurance system--- encodes all of the relevant information about her welfare. This is true regardless of whether workers are able to borrow and lend to smooth their consumption, or whether they must live hand-to-mouth. Intuitively, the after-tax reservation wage tells us the take-home pay required to make a worker indifferent between working and remaining unemployed. Since take-home pay translates directly into consumption, it is a valid measure of the worker's utility. Given the simplicity of the argument, it should not be surprising that this insight turns out to be robust to many variations of our basic model. To prove this result, we develop a formal dynamic model of job search with risk-aversion. Workers draw wages from a known distribution and accepted jobs last for a fixed amount of time. In order to abstract from wealth effects, we assume workers have constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) preferences.
w4857|How should an investor's attitude toward risk influence the composition of his portfolio? A simple and elegant answer to this question comes from the mutual-fund separation theorem. This theorem, a building block of the most basic Capital Asset Pricing Model, is taught regularly to undergraduates and business students. According to the theorem, more risk averse investors should hold more of their portfolio in the riskless asset. The composition of risky assets, however, should be the same for all investors. Popular financial advisors appear not to follow the mutual-fund separation theorem. When these advisors are asked to allocate portfolios among stocks, bonds, and cash, they recommend more complicated strategies than indicated by the theorem. Moreover, these strategies differ from the theorem in a systematic way. According to these advisors, more risk averse investors should hold a higher ratio of bonds to stocks. This advice contradicts the conclusion that all investors should hold risky assets in the same proportion.
w4508|Priest and Klein (1984) have advanced a theory to explain the selection of cases for trial.' In their model, cases go to trial if the parties are overly optimistic about their prospects of success; that is, if the difference between plaintiff and defendant estimates of the plaintiffs expected judgment exceeds the difference between trial costs and settlement costs. The limiting implication of their model is that, with equal stakes to the parties, as the fraction of cases going to trial approaches zero (either because plaintiff or defendant uncertainty about trial outcomes declines or because trial costs increase) plaintiff win rates at trial will approach 50 percent.
w6863|The extraordinary growth of the Internet in the last few years, from fewer than 5 million users in 1993 to 62 million in 1997 (Department of Commerce, 1998), has led some to speak of the birth of a "world without borders," where free communication, competitive markets, and extensive comparison shopping are a matter of course (see The Economist, 1997a; Hof, 1998; Pouliot, 1998). This apparent lack of geography in cyberspace, however, has raised some difficult issues regarding government policy toward the "new" economy, particularly regarding tax policy.
w2546|This paper exaJnines the effects of the level and length of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits on unemployment durations. The paper particularly studies individual behavior during the weeks just prior to when benefits lapse. Higher UI benefits are found to have a strong negative effect on the probability of leaving unemployment. However, the probability of leaving unemployment rises dramatically just prior to when benefits lapse. When the length of benefits is extended, the probability of a spell ending is also very high in the week benefits were previously expected to lapse. Individual data are used with accurate information on spell durations, and the level and length of benefits. Semiparametric estimation techniques are used and compared to alternative approaches. The semiparametric approach yields more plausible estimates and provides useful diagnostics. 2. Theory Unemployment behavior with finite duration UI has been analyzed in several ways. Mortensen (1977) uses a dynamic search model. In his model, individuals maximize the present value of expected utility, where utility is a function of income and leisure.
w8403|This paper seeks to understand the observed inertial behavior of inflation and persistence in aggregate quantities. To this end, we formulate and estimate a dynamic, general equilibrium model which incorporates staggered wage and price contracts. We use our model to investigate what mix of frictions can account for the evidence of inertia and persistence. For this exercise to be well defined, we must characterize inertia and persistence precisely. We do so using estimates of the dynamic response of inflation and aggregate variables to a monetary policy shock. With this characterization, the question that we ask reduces to: 'Can models with moderate degrees of nominal rigidities generate inertial inflation and persistent output movements in response to a monetary policy shock?'1 Our answer to this question is, 'yes'. The model that we construct has two key features. First, it embeds Calvo style nominal price and wage contracts.
w7180|A basic first-order condition holds that firms invest in produced capital to the point that its discounted return is equal to its production cost. How effective are firms in satisfying this condition? The endogenous investment hypothesis considered in this paper holds that the condition applies as a workable approximation, if not from year to year, at least over longer periods. Under the reasonable assumption that the securities issued by a firm are claims on its capital and therefore have a total value equal to the value of the capital, the observed value of the securities reveals the quantity of capital. The endogenous investment hypothesis implies that securities markets provide a way to measure intangible capital accumulated by the corporate sector, where both the flow of investment and the stock of capital are not directly observed. There are good reasons to believe that otherwise unmeasureable intangible capital is an important part of the capital of a modern economy. The endogenous investment hypothesis involves more than the proposition that the stock market capitalizes future shareholder returns.
w1648|Two major approaches to the study of unemployment have been followed. The equilibrium model assumes that real wage rates instantaneously adjust so as to bring the supply and demand of labor into equality. Unemployment is a consequence of erroneous expectations, andffor intertemporal labor supply substitution, andffor government policies such as unemployment insurance."'" In contrast, the disequilibrium model allows for the possibility that the real wage may fail to equate the supply and demand of labor. Unemployment occurs when the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the going real wage. Typically, in these models it is assumed that the observed quantity of labor during any given period is the minimum of the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. In the United States, most empirical work has followed the equilibrium paradigm.
w6220|Most research on rent control has focused on the extent to which rent control causes undersupply in the housing market (eg Olson, 1972, Fraser Institute, 1975, Downs, 1988, Gyourko and Linneman, 1989). Scholarly work on the minimum wage and other price controls has similarly focused on the effects of these controls on the overall quantity of jobs or goods (eg Card and Krueger, 1995, Murphy and Welch, 1996). The basic welfare analysis of price control, shown in Figure 1, is at this point a canonical ingredient of most introductory microeconomics classes. Most discussions of rent control limit themselves to the social costs of undersupply.
w11924|By the early eighties, after nearly two terms in congress, Senator Pete W. Domenici (R- NM) had made a name for himself. “He was a gray, pragmatic fiscal and social conservative who opposed abortion, gun control and same-sex marriage and supported school vouchers, tax cuts and mandatory three-strikes sentencing. He was no bleeding heart, no cause pleader.” 1 That is until the withdrawn, indecisive and confused behavior of his daughter Clare was diagnosed as atypical schizophrenia. Now Domenici is Congress’ leading advocate for health insurance parity for mental illness. He is not alone. Domenici built a multiparty coalition that has included five legislators, all of whose lives have been touched by mental illness. Senator Paul Wellstone’s (D-MN) older brother was severely mentally ill.
w4693|This paper offers a theory that incorporates the price rigidities essential to explain exchange-rate behavior without sacrificing the insights of the intertemporal approach to the current account. Until now, thinking on open-economy macroeconomics has been largely schizophrenic. Most of the theoretical advances since the late 1970s have been achieved by assuming away the awkward reality of sticky prices and instead developing the implications of dynamic optimization by the private sector. While the intertemporal approach has proved valuable for some facets of current-account analysis, many of the most fundamental problems in international finance cannot be seriously addressed in a setting of frictionless markets. Because the newer paradigm seems so ill-equipped to explain, for example, the effects of macroeconomic policies on output and exchange rates, empirical practitioners and policymakers have not yet been persuaded to abandon traditional aggregative Keynesian models. While the time-tested appeal of these models is undeniable, their lack of microfoundations presents problems at many levels. They ignore the intertemporal budget constraints central to any coherent picture of the current account and fiscal policy. They provide no clear description of how monetary policy affects production decisions.
w1785|A competitive firm equates its marginal cost to the market price of Its product. The equality of marginal cost and price Is a fundamental efficiency condition for the allocation of resources. When the condition holds, the purchasers of the product equate their marginal rates of substitution to the corresponding marginal rates of transformation. By contrast, under monopoly or oligopolyÂ» the allocation of output will be inefficient because price will exceed marginal cost. This paper derives and implements a method for estimating the ratio of price to marginal cost. The method Is different from the one used In most previous lnvestlgatlons-lnstead of assuming profit maximization and estimating the slope of the demand schedule (as In Rosse (1970)), it looks at actual changes in costs. Further, the method makes no assumptions about the cost function; it is completely nonparametrlc. In its simplest form, it estimates the ratio of price to marginal cost directly from data on price, output, and the quantities and prices of inputs. This form proves an exact basis for a test of the hypothesis that price equals marginal cost. It also can provide the basis for estimation in a non-competltlve setting when it Is plausible that price is a constant markup over marginal cost, as It would be for a seller facing a demand schedule with constant elasticity.
w4312|The tendency of different firms within an industry to cluster together has been noted at least since Marshall [1961 (1890)], for whom this tendency was a powerful testament to the existence of economies of agglomeration. Because these agglomerated industries sometimes form the nuclei of cities it is convenient to refer to them as "city-industries".1 Contemporary economists interested in understanding the economics of city-industries have brought them under the heading of economic behavior that displays strategic complementarities: an agent is better off when other agents choose the same action that he does, rather than being worse off due to increased competition. Models of this type of behavior, admirably surveyed by Krugman [1991a], typically display multiple equilibria. This property is alleged in the recent work of Arthur [1990] and Krugman [1991b] to extend to city-industries, where the equilibria are locations in different regions of the same country or in different countries entirely. This same work attempts to demonstrate that "history" plays a large role in determining which equilibrium is actually chosen as the outcome. In Arthur's model, firms enter the industry in sequence. Each firm chooses a location on the basis of how many firms are there at the time of entry and a random vector that gives the firm's tastes for each possible location.
w1793|The economic approach to fertility has emphasized the effects of parents' income and the cost of rearing children. The most important determinants of cost have been employment opportunities of children, the value of parents' time spent on child care, monetary and psychological costs of avoiding births through abstinence and birth-control methods, and the interaction between the "quality" and quantity of children. With the exception of work by Richard Easterlin (1973) and a few others (eg, Becker [1981, Chapter 7]), studies that use an economic approach have neglected the analytical links between decisions by different generations of the same family.

w2279|The asymmetric treatment of gains and losses by the corporate income tax has figured prominently in many areas of research about the effects of taxation on firm behavior. One theory of capital structure has focused on the limited deductibility of marginal interest payments to explain the existence of optimal interior debt-equity ratios (DeAngelo and Masulis 1980). Another area of research has considered the impact of the limited loss offset mechanism on the cost of capital and investment incentives (Auerbach 1983, 1986, Cooper and Franks 1983, Majd and Myers 1985, Mayer 1986, Mintz 1985).
w3325|One of the most surprising features of the process of economic growth is the wide cross-country dispersion in average rates of growth. In the post-war period countries like Japan. Brazil and Gabon saw their level of per capita income expand at a fast pace while other nations experienced no significant change in their standard of living. This paper studies a class of growth models in which cross-country differences in economic policy can generate this type of heterogeneity in growth experiences. In these models certain policy variables, such as the rate of income tax. affect the economy's rate of expansion through a simple mechanism: an increase in the income tax rate decreases the rate of return to the investment activities of the private sector and leads to a permanent decline in the rate of capital accumulation and in the rate of growth.
w9171|Throughout history, hate-filled individuals have paid huge personal costs to impose even larger costs on others. The destruction of the World Trade Center is only the latest example of massive, self-sacrificing violence fueled by the hatred of members of one group towards another group.1 But hatred, which I take to mean the willingness to sacrifice personally to harm others, is as variable as it is powerful. Before 1945, Franco-German hatred was a regular feature of European life. It is no longer. Racial discrimination may be a pervasive feature of American society, but actual hatred of African-Americans was ubiquitous only in the South and only between 1865 and 1970. While anti-Semitism still exists, the virulent hatred of Jews that was dominant in the 1930s has not been widespread in the western democracies since World War II.
w0885|The standard model of optimal growth, interpreted as a model of a market economy with infinitely long-lived agents does not allow separation of the savings decisions of agents from the investment decisions of firms. Investment is essentially passive: the "one good" assumption leads to a perfectly elastic investment supply; the absence of installation costs for investment leads to a perfectly elastic investment demand. On the other hand, the standard model of temporary equilibrium used in macroeconomics, such as the Metzler [6] model for example, .
w1231|The Food Stamp program in the United States has grown into one of the largest noncategorical income maintenance programs run by the Federal government. In 1982 nearly $11 billion worth of stamps were paid out to households containing 22 million members. Food Stamps have become the negative income tax that was never enacted. They are generally available, offer a minimum guarantee, and are reduced by some fraction (now .82) for each dollar of additional countable income the household obtains from other sources. Unique among income maintenance programs, Food Stamp benefits are paid not in the form of checks, cash, or reimbursements to vendors, but rather in the form of specially printed Stamps that eligible recipients obtain at certified disbursement outlets near their homes. These stamps in turn are used to purchase qualifying commodities.
w19900|Intangible capital is an important factor of production in modern economies. It is rarely introduced in business cycle models, however, perhaps because it is assumed to have little impact on the short-run dynamics of macroeconomic variables, or viewed as too difficult to measure. In this paper, we present preliminary results showing that intangible capital can have a substantial impact on business cycle dynamics, and offer some new empirical evidence relating to our theory.
w5024|The overall sex gap in wages can be broken into an across-occupation and a within-occupation component. The sex gap related to across-occupation segregation has alternatively been attributed to human capital investment (Polachek, 1981), preferences (Daymont and Andrisani, 1984), and employment discrimination (Beller, 1982; Bergmann, 1974). The sex gap that remains within occupations may reflect pure pay discrimination between men and women working alongside one another. Or it may reflect segregation across jobs, within occupations, sometimes called "vertical segregation" (Berch, 1982).1 Such segregation may arise for the same reasons as segregation across occupations. In this paper we investigate the role of discrimination in vertical segregation among waiters and waitresses.
w2642|If markets were complete and perfect, or if there was some other institution or mechanism that implemented a full information pareto optimal consumption allocation, then individuals' consumption would vary only with aggregate consumption and would not respond to idiosyncratic variations in income or wealth. This proposition can be viewed as a cross sectional counterpart to the permanent income hypothesis: perfect insurance implies that consumption growth should not vary across individuals in response to idiosyncratic shocks, just as perfect asset markets imply that an individual's consumption should not vary over time in response to temporary shocks in income. At face value this is a ludicrous proposition: the consumption of state lottery winners certainly rises, even when aggregate consumption declines. However, it is not so obvious that the proposition is ludicrous for shocks that are important to macroeconomists: when an consumer loses his job, gets sick, works in an industry that suffers a loss in demand, etc., does that consumer suffer a loss of wealth, revealed in his consumption choice? Or are such shocks effectively insured, either by formal institutions such as unemployment and disability insurance, or by the network of informal institutions that can proxy for insurance, including gifts and "loans" from relatives, friends and neighbors, "labor hoarding" or other implicit insurance on the part of employers, local or national charities, etc.
w9492|The potential economic benefits from replacing the current income tax system with a flat (proportional) consumption tax system have generated a considerable amount of attention in recent years. Examples of a flat consumption tax include a value-added tax (VAT) in many European nations as well as a national retail sales tax that is gaining attention in the United States as a possible substitute tax base. Replacing the current income tax system with a revenue-neutral flat consumption tax would (i) flatten tax rates, (ii) tax consumption rather than wage and capital income, and (iii) eliminate all tax-base reductions (preferences) contained in current law.
w6901|Workers differ in ability. Whereas some like Michael Jordan and Luciano Pavarotti have special talents that are useful only in certain occupations, most of the variation in ability is more general in nature. Individuals who are endowed with high intelligence, good health, and ample energy, and those who have had the benefit of a supportive upbringing and a quality education are potentially more productive in a wide range of activities than those who have been less fortunate along some or all of these dimensions. One of the most important functions of the labor market is to allocate the heterogenous pool of talent to the different sectors of the economy. In a world of perfect labor contracts (and competitive firms, complete markets, etc.), the allocation of talent would be efficient.
w11014|In a democracy, the majority rules. Often, this means that policy choices reﬂect more the preferences of some citizens than others. This feature of democracy–popularly known as “tyranny of the majority”–arises in institutional settings in which elected officials represent disproportionately the interests of their own constituents and electees who represent the minority have limited means to inﬂuence policy. In this paper, we argue that tyranny of the majority imparts a protectionist bias to democratic politics. This is so even when the average citizen covets free trade and when every citizen has an equal probability of being represented in the policymaking process. By “protection” we mean policies that favor quasi-fixed factors of production.
w1237|Analysis of retirement behavior has progressed rapidly from the estimation of reduced form equations which were linked only loosely, if at all, to any theoretical framework, to the structural analysis presented In the path-breaking study by Roger Gordon and Alan Blinder (1980). Much of this progress reflects the increasing feasibility of estimating structural models directly using maximum likelihood techniques. However, the usefulness of this approach depends, as always in econometrics, on the armraâffirsâ¬ the underlying model. It is our contention that there remain serious problems in the specification of these models which must be remedied before we have an estimated structural model accurately depicting the retirement decision. The purpose of this paper is to estimate a more appropriately specified model and to assess how the improved specification affects the estimates. Previous work has had problems in two broad dimensions of specification which will be addressed in this paper.1 First, available structural retirement models misrepresent the choices facing older workers.
w3599|Why do different countries—or the same country in different periods—grow at such different rates? And what is the role of income distribution in the growth process? To answer these old questions, we belive one should explain why growth-promoting policies are or are not adopted. In this paper we try to do just that by combining insights from two recent strands of literature, namely the theory of endogenous growth and the theory of endogenous policy. We can summarize our tentative conclusion in a simple aphorism: inequality is harmful for growth. The arguments that lead us to this aphorism run as follows. Economic growth is largely determined by the accumulation of knowledge usable in production.
w7048|The goal of this paper is to analyze a model to explain consumption by couples. It is an extension of the model for singles by Yaari (1965), and therefore emphasizes the role of mortality risk. It also allows for a what I call a "true" bequest motive, bequeathing by a couple to the next generation, or at least to others outside of their own two-person household. The distinction between a true bequest motive and simply the provision for a surviving spouse is important because the surviving spouse is the extension of the original household, and the survivor had a direct influence in choosing the consumption by the couple when the deceased spouse was alive. This makes the situation very different from a true bequest where the bequest depends at least partly on motives other than purely selfish consumption and where the bequeathed has no direct control on the consumption by the household.
w3431|Since the time of Modigliani and Miller's famous irrelevance theorem, economists have devoted much effort to relaxing the theorem's assumptions in order to understand the real-world trade-offs between debt, equity and other corporate financial instruments. In particular, literatures have developed that explain financial structure as an attempt to reduce taxes (see, eg, Modigliani and Miller (1963) and Miller (1977)); as a signaling device (see, eg, Leland-Pyle (1977) and Ross (1977)); as a bonding device (see, eg, Grossman-Hart (1982) and Jensen (1986)); as a way of completing markets (see, eg, Stiglitz (1974) and Allen-Gale (1988)); or as a device for dividing up control rights between various claimant groups (see, eg, Aghion-Bolton (1988), Hart-Moore (1989), Bolton-Scharfstein (1990), Diamond (1989), Harris-Raviv (1989) and Zender (1989)).
w6106|Understanding the role of genetic and family background factors is a critical component of most public policy discussions about the effectiveness of investments in education. Attempts to understand the influence of schooling on the increased income inequality observed in recent years have heightened the concern with these issues.^ Publication of the influential Bell Curve [1994], with its claim that genetic endowments predetermine income, has made attempts to understand these issues even more urgent.
w0468|It is conventional to assess the merits of alternative public policies in terms of a trade-off between equity and efficiency. In practice, however, a change in, say,the tax system involves three effects. First, it may have incentive or disincentive effects leading to efficiency gains or losses. Secondly, it may alter the distribution of welfare levels. Thirdly, it may alter the ranking of individuals (or households) within the distribution. These three effects correspond to efficiency, vertical equity, and (certain aspects of) "horizontal equity" respectively, and any assessment of a tax change must take into account all three. The principal assumption of this paper is that the government is concerned about the trade-off between these three effects. The introduction of changes in the ranking into the evaluation of a distribution is an example of how non-utility considerations may enter social rankings (See Sen (1979) and Pattanaik (1980)).
w16388|International trade has been liberalized dramatically since the end of World War II. According to WTO estimates, the average ad valorem tariff on manufacturing goods has been reduced from over 40 percent to below 4 percent during this time period. This dramatic liberalization was largely the result of a sequence of successful rounds of trade negotiations governed by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor the World Trade Organization (WTO).1 The GATTffWTO is an institution regulating trade negotiations through a set of prenegotiated articles. The principles of reciprocity and nondiscrimination are usually considered to be the essence of these articles.
w9528|Many economic activities are agglomerated: people are crowded into a small fraction of the Earth's land mass; individual industries are geographically concentrated; trading is concentrated in a few marketplaces. The standard way to account for concentration (and the arbitrariness of where activity concentrates) has been to propose "tipping models" with three equilibria: one with most activity at location A; one with most activity at B; and an unstable "knife-edge" equilibrium with exactly half of the activity in each market. At the core of most models of agglomeration is some type of increasing returns or "scale effect" that favors the emergence of a single dominant site. In some of these models, all agents are ex-ante identical, and they all prefer to be part of the larger market.
w13104|Financial development accelerates economic growth and improves economic performance to the extent that it facilitates the migration of funds to the best user, ie to the place in the economic system where the funds will earn the highest social return, noted Goldsmith (1969, p. 400) some thirty five years ago. Ever since then, economists have been developing theories and searching for empirical evidence connecting financial and economic development together. Information production plays a key role in this process of steering of funds to the highest valued users in two ways. First, intermediaries collect and analyze information about potential investments before funds are committed by savers. Second, after savers have devoted their funds to investment, intermediaries monitor the activities of borrowers to ensure that the best return is attained.
w16988|Consumers are heterogenous in many ways including preferences, income, transportation cost and storage costs. Consumer heterogeneity generates incentives for firms to price discriminate. When consumer types are unobservable firms rely on various screening mechanisms to achieve separation. Empirically, we know little about the potential benefits from price discrimination in actual settings, or how well various screening mechanisms work. Furthermore, the impact of price discrimination on welfare, especially in an oligopoly setting, is theoretically unclear. The goal of this paper is to empirically study the role of intertemporal price discrimination in storable goods markets. In these markets, temporary price reductions (sales) can be a way to separate between consumers based on their ability to store. We estimate preferences, and use the estimates to test whether sales can be driven by price discrimination.
w11971|In recent years there has been considerable progress in developing structural models of inﬂation and output dynamics. A common aspect of this approach is to begin with the individual firm’s price setting problem, obtain optimal decision rules, and then aggregate behavior. The net result is a simple relation for inﬂation that is much in the spirit of a traditional Phillips curve: Inﬂation depends on a measure of real activity as well as expectations of the future. In addition to its forward-looking nature, this relationship also differs from the traditional Phillips curve in that all the coefficients are explicit functions of the primitives of the model. To date, these new Phillips curves (often grouped under the heading of “New Keynesian”) reﬂect a pragmatic compromise between theoretical rigor and the need for empirical tractability.
w9729|If you want to sell something, it helps to be close to your customers. This truism leaves unanswered the question why proximity to one's market is good for business. The answer given by economic geography is very simple: transportation costs are increasing in distance, so it is more costly to deliver products to consumers far away than to those near the production location. With mobile factors of production, this "market access" motive leads to agglomeration near the source of final demand. When factors cannot move, remote factors will be paid less in equilibrium than those that are fortunate enough to be located near their customers.
w15602|Every year a large number of convicted criminals are sent to prison. Given that prisons are expensive to build and run, and often involve cruel treatment of fellow citizens, possibly contributing to the conversion of inmates into =hardened criminals, it is unsurprising that alternatives to imprisonment have been tried out. One of the more intriguing experiments in this area is the substitution of incarceration for electronic monitoring (EM).1 =Tagging, as it is also sometimes called, involves fitting offenders with an electronic device (typically on the ankle) that can be monitored remotely by employees of a correctional facility who can verify whether the individual is violating a set of pre-established conditions. The most common of these conditions is to stay at home, although in some cases a provision for attending work or school is included. By 2007, more than 250,000 people in the US and Europe alone had been =treated with electronic monitoring, in spite of the obvious complexity of a full cost-benefit analysis. In this paper we seek to contribute to an evaluation of electronic monitoring (and more broadly to the debate about the effectiveness of using prisons) by providing one of the estimates needed for such an exercise: the difference between the recidivism rate of offenders formerly under electronic monitoring and the recidivism rate for offenders released from a standard prison. 1 See, for example, the discussions in Schwitzgebel (1969), Petersilia (1987), Schmidt and Curtis (1987), Morris and Tonry (1990), Tonry (1998), and Payne and Gainey (1998). Theoretically, the difference in these two recidivism rates is ambiguous. On the one hand, specific deterrence theory suggests that spending time under electronic monitoring rather than incarceration might make low punishment salient, implying a positive relationship between light punishment (electronic monitoring) and ulterior recidivism. On the other hand, several theories point out to a negative relationship. For example, imprisonment might be criminogenic through harsh prison conditions or peer effects that are not present under electronic monitoring. In particular, electronic monitoring could prevent contact with hardened criminals, or reduce the perception that society is =mean and =deserving of the crime it receives (one variation is in Sherman and Strang, 2007). Moreover, electronic monitoring could differ from prison in its effect on the improvement of skills (social, applied or cognitive) and labor market prospects.2 A simple comparison of recidivism rates across the prison and electronic monitoring samples, however, is typically unlikely to be very informative. There are at least two practical empirical problems in trying to derive a causal estimate, one of which can be called a problem of selection and the second a problem of differential risk of the target population.
w0335|In a number of recent papers (Kareken, Muench and Wallace [1973], LcRoy [1975], Friedman [1975, 1977], Woglom [1979], Black [1976, 1977], Boyer [1978] Roper and Turnovsky [1978], Siegel [1978] and Woglom [1979]), the ability of the policy authorities to stabilize the economy has been shown to depend in an important way on the extent to which the current value of the policy instrument(s) can be made a function of current random disturbances---more precisely of the innovations in these disturbances. This issue is especially important for financial policy and foreign exchange market intervention and exchange rate management. Financial policy instruments, be they financial asset stocks, interest rates or exchange rates can be adjusted virtually continuously and costlessly. Some financial market data (eg, exchange rate observations, stock prices and transactions in government debt) are observable and available on a fairly current basis. Such currently observable data provide information about the sources of random shocks to the economy. Financial policy should be conducted in such a way as to extract the information contained in observable financial market data and exploit it in achieving the authorities' stabilization objectives. In this paper I evaluate the effect of general linear policy rules on the behavior of a number of stochastic linear rational expectations models. This extends the analysis of Aoki and Canzoneri [1979] who only consider feedback policy.
w2914|The recent depreciation of the dollar has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the US. According to many business people and members of the press, the link between these two phenomena is an obvious one: a weak dollar makes certain US assets seem cheap to foreigners, who hold their wealth in other currencies. This story is often told with either an implicit or explicit warning about the unfavorable welfare effects involved in such a "fire sale" of US assets.
w17546|Neoclassical growth theory establishes a presumption that countries with access to identical technologies should converge to a common income level. Countries that are poorer and have higher marginal productivity of capital should therefore grow faster in the transition to the long-run steady state. However, empirical work has not been very kind to this proposition. There is no tendency for poor countries to grow faster than rich ones, over any reasonably long time horizon for which we have data (see Figure 1).1 Whatever convergence one can find is conditional: it depends on policies, institutions, and other country-specific circumstances. The only exceptions to the rule seem to be statesffregions within a unified economy such as the United States (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991).2 If growth rates are characterized by conditional instead of unconditional convergence, economies will tend towards different levels of income in the long-run.
w2280|A common assumption in empirical macroeconomics is that behavior can be summarized in terms of a representative agent. To the extent that this assumption is violated, aggregate equations are misspecified. If the income and age distributions of the population are fairly constant across time, the misspecification due to the representative agent assumption may be small and not of much concern. A striking feature of the post-war US society, however, has been the baby boom of the late 1940's and the 1950's and the subsequent falling off of the birth rate in the 1960's.
w12537|Business cycle data feature two important forms of comovement. The first is aggregate comovement: major macroeconomic aggregates, such as output, consumption, investment, hours worked, and the real wage tend to rise and fall together. The second is sectoral comovement: output, employment, and investment tend to rise and fall together in different sectors of the economy. Lucas (1977) argues that these comovement properties reflect the central role that aggregate shocks play in driving business fluctuations. However, it is surprisingly difficult to generate both aggregate and sectoral comovement, even in models driven by aggregate shocks. Barro and King (1984) show that the one-sector growth model generates aggregate comovement only in the presence of contemporaneous shocks to total factor productivity (TFP).
w5439|The problem of explaining why the world economy collapsed in the 1930s has provided a difficult challenge to economists for more than six decades. Thus it is particularly exciting that in the last few years there has developed something of a new consensus about the sources of the Great Depression. The distinctive claim of this emerging view--which is based on the research of a number of scholars and has been given am authoritative treatment by Eichengreen [1992]--is that the proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. A brief synopsis of the "gold standard theory" of the Depression is as follows: For a variety of reasons, including among others the desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the US stock market boom, monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s--a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard fiHamilton 1987, 1988; Temin 1989].1 What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international "scramble for gold".
w4575|Can purely economic models of policy choice characterize the outcome of actual policy decisions? Answering this question is central to developing satisfactory positive models of policy choice. Two broad, contrary perspectives can be discerned. The first characterizes the "optimal" policy from economic fundamentals and tests its predictions. Barro (1979) on the determination of government debt is a good example of this. This approach goes hand-in-hand with a political economy in which there are sufficient forces to ensure that optimal policies are indeed chosen. Wittman (1990) offers the purist statement of this view. Stigler (1971) and Becker (1983) have developed analyses of specific institutional contexts where the adoption of eiBcient policies is implied. The implications for the theory of public finance of such views are profound. For example, Ramsey's tax rules become a positive model of tax policy and Samuelson's rule for the provision of public goods, and its generalizations, becomes a prediction about what will be done in practice.
w12498|A long standing challenge in macroeconomics is accounting for the relatively smooth behavior of real wages over the business cycle along with the relatively volatile behavior of employment. A recent body of research, beginning with Shimer (2005a), Hall (2005a) and Costain and Reiter (2003), has re-ignited interest in addressing this challenge. These authors show that the conventional model of unemployment dynamics due to Mortensen and Pissarides (hereafter "MP") cannot account for the key cyclical movements in labor market activity, at least for standard calibrations of parameters. The basic problem is that the mechanism for wage determination within this framework, period-by-period Nash bargaining between firms and workers, induces too much volatility in wages.
w11245|One of the most durable propositions in macroeconomics is that wages respond to unemployment. Although the persistence of depressions and recessions suggests that the response is not immediate and complete, the notion that wages respond to unemployment over time—the essence of the Phillips curve—remains persuasive. Modern thinking about the issue is much under the inﬂuence of the Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model of the labor market. In that model, the unemployed meet occasionally with suitable employers. At the time a job-seeker and an em- ployer meet, the two parties enjoy a potential surplus from forming a match—the surplus is the excess of what the match would produce over what they would get if the job-seeker returned to search and the job remained unfilled.
w11874|Monetary policy making is complex. Central bankers examine a vast array of data, hear from a variety of advisors, use suites of models to interpret the data, and apply judgment to adjust the predictions of models. This process produces a monetary policy rule that is a complicated, probably non-linear, function of a large set of information about the state of the economy. For both descriptive and prescriptive reasons, macroeconomists seek simple char- acterizations of policy. Perhaps the most successful simplification is due to Taylor (1993). He finds that a very simple rule does a good job of describing Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, particularly since 1982. Taylor’s rule is it = fii + α(πt − π ∗ ) + γxt + εt, (1) ∗ where it is the central bank’s policy interest rate, fii is the long-run policy rate, πt is inﬂation, π is the central bank’s inﬂation target, x is output, and ε is a random variable. With settings of α = 1.5 and γ = .
w5625|Starting with the classic "paradox" of Leontief (1953), and continuing through the influential work of Bowen, Learner and Sveikauskas (1987), the Heckscher-Ohlin model has consistently performed poorly in empirical tests. This led Trefler (1993) to aver that "its predictions are always rejected empirically." In spite of these empirical failures, the Heckscher-Ohlin model remains ubiquitous in theory, empirics and policy analysis. In part, this reflects an a priori belief that the model embodies fundamental general equilibrium links between primary factors and production structure that we believe will be part of any fully articulated and empirically relevant theory.1 Moreover, we will argue that when applied to regions within a country, the theory may do quite well as a simple description of the data.
w9755|Paul Samuelson’s assertion suggests, the textbook model of a competitive labor market predicts that an immigrant influx should lower the wage of competing factors.1 Despite the intuitive appeal of this theoretical implication and despite the large number of careful studies in the literature, the existing evidence provides a mixed and confusing set of results. The measured impact of immigration on the wage of native workers fluctuates widely from study to study (and sometimes even within the same study), but seems to cluster around zero. A widely cited survey by Friedberg and Hunt [1995, p. 42] concludes that “the effect of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives is small.
w1899|There is a significant gap between the theory and empirical work in the standard models of investment. This paper offers some plausible estimates of investment dynamics that are both consistent with a structural model and useful for policy analysis. Because the choice of capital stock is inherently connected with the choice of other factors, labor in particular, the model is of capacity choice in general instead of investment in particular. When a firm purchases or hires factors of production, it determines its productive capacity. Short-run variation in output comes principally from variation in factors that are adjustable at little or no cost. Investment responds relatively slowly to shocks because of adjustment costs. In this paper I provide structural estimates of demand for factors--- capital in particular. These estimates can be used for analyses of tax policy that are immune from the Lucas critique. The dynamic response of investment implied by the estimates is more plausible than that found in previous research. I use a model where the firm maximizes the present discounted value of profits subject to a technology with adjustment costs. Such a specification has a long history in the investment literature. Moreover, it is a generalization of Tobin's q-model, which is equivalent to an adjustment cost model where only capital is costly to adjust. The firm chooses its capital stock, its number of production and non-production workers, and hours of production workers. I estimate the first-order conditions, or Euler equations, of the problem rather than the closed-form decision rules. The estimation technique is Hansen's [1982] generalized method of moments.
w7791|In the United States, more than two-thirds of testate decedents with multichild families divide their estates exactly equally among their children.1 This finding challenges the validity of existing theories regarding the determination of intergenerational transfers. If testators select the bequest to each heir by balancing marginal benefits against marginal costs, then it is natural to think of equal division as a knife-edge, "measure zero" event. If. for example, bequests reflect altruism (as in Becker [8] or Barro [7]) or intrafamily exchange (as in Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers [15] or Kotlikoff and Spivak [27]), one would ordinarily expect the optimal bequest to vary with the characteristics of the child, so that children with different characteristics would receive different bequests. These observations give rise to the "equal division puzzle." Though economic theory has been almost completely silent on this subject,2 two simple possibilities merit consideration.
w9701|One of the strongest relationships established in the empirical growth literature is the positive correlation between the investment rate in physical capital and the level of output per worker. As illustrated by figure 1, a well-known stylized fact is that the PPP investment rate of wealthy countries such as Norway and the US is roughly 2 to 3 times higher than that of poor countries such as Mali and Kenya. This positive correlation also holds when considering the growth rate, rather than the level, of output per worker.1 Based on this evidence, empirical work accounting for why some countries are rich and others are poor has assigned an important role to differences in physical capital intensity.
w15870|Modern economies often experience episodes of large movements in asset prices that cannot be explained by changes in economic conditions or fundamentals. It is commonplace to refer to these episodes as bubbles popping up and bursting. Typically, these bubbles are unpredictable and generate substantial macroeconomic effects. Consumption, investment and productivity growth all tend to surge when a bubble pops up, and then collapse or stagnate when the bubble bursts. Here, we address the following questions: What is the origin of these bubbly episodes? Why are they unpredictable?
w3851|Economic growth is driven by private investment decisions in the models proposed by Romer (1986,1987,1988,1990), Lucas (1988), Jones and Manuelli (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and others; thus, the rate of growth can be accelerated by policy measures which increase the profit flow accruing to new units of capital andffor decrease their price in terms of consumption. From a hypothetical social planner's point of view, such growth-oriented policy interventions are desirable whenever non-accumulated factors of production receive a positive, nondecreasing share of output in laisstz-faWe equilibrium: aggregate production must eventually increase linearly with accumulation for unceasing endogenous growth to be possible, hence positive remuneration of non-accumulated factors is inconsistent with first-best growth unless, as in Jones and Manuelli (1990), those factors are asymptotically unnecessary for production. If the economy is not populated by "representative" individuals, however, growth-oriented policies need not improve every agent's welfare in the absence of redistribution.
w1075|The theory of international trade has been extended in recent years to incorporate uncertain trading environments. The early writers in this area (eg Kemp and Liviatan (1973), Turnovsky (1974) and Batra (1975)) argued that the introduction of randomness into the standard deterministic models had proven to be very damaging to many orthodox results, including those concerning the pattern of trade. However, as Helpman and Razin (1978a, 1978b) later showed, many of the negative findings were due to the implicity assumed absence of markets for international risk sharing in those early models. When international trade in equities is admitted as a possibility, a number of the familiar theorems are restored.
w7983|When analyzing public policy in dynamic models with a representative agent, it is standard practice to pick the consumption stream that maximizes the representative agent's utility function. Since this practice is so universal, it is almost unnecessary to cite examples. One can simply thumb through any textbook treatment of growth theory, such as Barro and Sali-i-Martin [1995] or Romer [1996], or any analysis of optimal monetary or fiscal policy, such as Lucas and Stokey [1983] or Chari and Kehoe [1999]. The implicit assumption in all of these treatments is that the appropriate social discount rate for future consumption is the same as the private discount rate. Occasionally there have been those who have voiced discomfort with this prescription, especially those seeking to orient public policy more towards the future. Ramsey [1928], while acknowledging that private agents discount the future, argued that it was "ethically indefensible" for the government to do so. Pigou [1929], Allais [1947], and Solow [1974] have expressed similar views. For the most part, however, these views have either been ignored or dismissed as paternalistic by the majority of economists.
w0546|Our aim in this paper is to determine under what conditions there exists an equilibrium aggregate debt-equity ratio, and, if such exists, to examine its dependence on the risk preferences and tax rates of the investors in the market. Miller (1977) has conjectured that even if no optimal debt-equity ratio exists for an individual firm, there will be an equilibrium aggregate debt-equity ratio which will equal the relative wealth levels of .those with tax preferences for debt as opposed to equity. This is true, however, only in special cases, and we examine a more general model below. In particular, we shall highlight the critical role which constraints (on, for example, personal borrowing or short sales) play in the determination of the market equilibrium.1 The role of constraints when the tax system is non-neutral has been discussed by Black (1971, 1973), King (1974,1977) and Auerbach (1979).

w3906|Consider an individual entrepreneur who has access to a profitable investment project, but does not have the funds to finance it. In an ideal world, the entrepreneur would raise the capital from an outside investor (eg a bank), promising in return a sufficient fraction of future cash flows that the investor breaks even. Such an ex-ante division of surplus may be unenforceable, however, if the entrepreneur always has the option to repudiate the contract by withdrawing his human capital from the project. The possibility of repudiation puts an upper bound on the total amount of future indebtedness from the entrepreneur to the investor at any date. We show that the result of this constraint is that some profitable projects will not be financed. In addition, we characterize the optimal repayment path between the entrepreneur and the investor when the project is financed, and show how this repayment path is affected both by the maturity structure of the project return stream and by the durability and specificity of the project assets. Our results are consistent with the conventional wisdom offered by practitioners about what determines the maturity structure of (long-term) debt contracts.
w2095|James Tobin relates the following story, which was told to him and other members of the Harvard graduate economics club by Professor WL Crum. In the 1920's the Harvard Economic Service (HES) issued monthly reports on the current and their expected future state of the economy. HES used three indices, representing speculation, business, and money, to help predict the future. Crum said that in the summer of 1929 the statistical assistant at HES became alarmed when she noticed that the charts indicated that a sharp downturn in economic activity was imminent. Crum did not see in the current business situation any cause for this adverse forecast. Moreover, he feared that a pessimistic forecast by the influential service could itself have an adverse effect on financial markets and economic activity. Therefore, he suppressed the pessimistic findings of the assistant,1 and the published report did not speak of a potential downturn. The data, in fact, provide only mild support for this account. The account does, however, raise an interesting and general set of questions.
w8704|During the 1980's and early 1990's, the United States and several European countries expressed strong dissatisfaction with what they deemed to be inadequate protection of intellectual property in many developing countries. The developed countries made the upgrading of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection one of their highest priorities for the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Their efforts in those negotiations bore fruit in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), which was approved as part of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round. The TRIPs agreement establishes minimum standards of protection for several categories of intellectual property.
w4272|This paper discusses the current treatment of the introduction of generic versions of previously patented (and branded) drugs into the official price indexes and suggests some alternative ways of proceeding. While generic pharmaceuticals are the substantive topic, the problem discussed is of much wider importance. It is a special and possibly "easy" case of the more general problem of new goods and quality change, where different quality versions are interpreted as new goods. In trying to solve the general quality change problem, official statistical agencies may unintentionally aggravate and overdo it, by defining commodities too narrowly and treating each new variety as a new good. Because new goods are usually 'linked-in" rather than compared directly to the previous versions, the explicit and implicit price declines that consumers experience as the result of their appearance do not show up in the official mdexes, ever.
w8896|The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is one of the central determinants of households' intertemporal consumption choices. In the certainty case it can be computed as minus the elasticity of the ratio of consumption in period t to consumption in period I + 1 with respect to the relative price of consumption in the two periods d(CtffCt+i)(l + Rf,t) = d(ln(Ct+iffCt)) m d(l + Ru) CtffCt+i d (In (1 + Rf,t)) where Rf,t is the net return on the riskless asset in period t.
w8270|Do market economies allocate risk efficiently? If not, what government policies can improve the allocation of risk? These are classic questions of economic theory. One celebrated answer comes from the Arrow-Debreu theory of general equilibrium. This theory teaches that under certain conditions--in particular, if contingent-claims markets are complete--the allocation of risk will be Pareto efficient. In other words, with complete markets, society can let the invisible hand allocate risk. This paper explores a deviation from Arrow-Debreu theory that arises from a simple fact that not everyone is born at the beginning of time. In an overlapping-generations economy, markets must be incomplete, because a person cannot engage in risk-sharing trades with those who are not yet born. The risks associated with holding capital assets, for instance, can be shared with others alive at the same time, but they cannot be shared with future generations. As a result, the allocation of risk need not be efficient, and government policy may be able to make Pareto improvements.
w4608|Consider a board of directors attempting to do its fiduciary duty of maximizing shareholder wealth. In incumbent management's hands the company is worth its current, publicly observed, stock price. A raider, or several raiders, privately approach the board, offering to buy the company at a premium to the current price. The raiders are willing to negotiate on price. The board considers several options. The first option is to negotiate with the raiders for the best possible price. The second option is to publicly announce that the company is for sale, and hold an open auction among the raiders and any other bidders who may then emerge. A third option is to negotiate with the raiders, maintaining the right to hold an auction subsequently if the negotiations do not lead to a sale. Which option is best? The advantage of negotiating is that the seller may be able to bargain the raiders into agreeing to pay a higher price by, for example, credibly threatening not to sell if the buyers' offers are too low, making an offer to one buyer that depends on information learned from other buyers, and maintaining the prerogative of discriminating among buyers' bids. We assume that the directors are extremely skilled at negotiations; in fact, we assume that they can use whatever sales mechanism will maximize expected profit from a given set of bidders.
w4768|When technology, in its broadest sense, is embodied in capital, skills, and the organization of work, technical progress puts the economy in a state of incessant restructuring, Its productive structure must constantly adapt to innovations in products, techniques, modes of organization, and to the evolving competitiveness of world markets. Production units that embody new techniques must continually be created, while outdated units must be destroyed. This process of growth through Schumpeterian "creative destruction" results in aii ongoing reallocation of factors of production from contracting production sites to expanding ones.1 This idea finds strong support in recent studies of productivity growth using plant-level LRD data.
w11756|Taxes have an important impact on effective asset returns for taxable investors. If the marginal investor is subject to taxes, then asset valuations and asset returns should reﬂect this tax burden in equilibrium. In particular, to compensate taxable investors for their tax burden, before-tax asset returns should be higher and asset valuations should be lower in periods of relatively high tax rates. On the other hand, taxes should not affect asset valuations if the marginal investor is effectively tax-exempt, as first discussed by Miller and Scholes (1978). This study tests empirically whether dividend and capital gains taxes are capitalized into asset prices using a new data set covering personal tax burdens on the aggregate US stock market over the period between 1917-2004.
w3189|Two themes pervade the growth and development literature. The first is Kuznets' (1955) hypothesis on the relationship between economic growth and the distribution of income. On the basis of somewhat slender evidence, Kuznets (1955) cautiously offered the proposition that during the course of an economy's lifetime, income inequality rises during the childhood stage of development, tapers off during the juvenile stage, and finally declines as adulthood is reached. While far from being incontrovertible, other researchers have found evidence in support of this hypothesis. For example, Lindert and Williamson (1985) suggest that "British experience since 1688 looks like an excellent advertisement for the Kuznets Curve, with income inequality rising across the Industrial Revolution, followed by a prolonged leveling in the last quarter of the nineteenth century" (p. 344). Using cross-country data, Paukert (1973) finds evidence of intra-country income inequality rising and then declining with economic development. Finally, inter-country inequality is examined by Summers, Kravis, and Heston (1984).
w16119|Some countries are unlikely to ever join a legally binding climate treaty. Only 37 countries are currently committed to binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Since these commitments are set to expire in 2012, the United Nations negotiated the Copenhagen Accord in December, 2009. The Accord recognizes the need to reduce global CO2 emissions but it does not legally bind the signatories in any way. Despite this, it was unable to secure full participation. While nonparticipants are likely to pollute too much, the main concern is that they might undo the climate coalition's effort. When the coalition introduces regulation, world prices change, market shares shift, industries relocate, and nonparticipants may end up emitting more than they did before. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007:665) defines carbon leakage as "the increase in CO2 emissions outside the countries taking domestic mitigation action divided by the reduction in the emissions of these countries." Most estimates of leakage are in the interval 5-25 percent, but the number can be higher if the coalition is small, the policy ambitious, and the time horizon long.
w10926|and Summary During the last half century, policymakers in the US have consistently sought to chart a stable course for economic growth. The importance accorded to this goal does not merely owe to the views of select policymakers, but is mandated by law. In 1946, Congress passed the Employment Act, which encouraged the federal government to adopt policies that would lead to maximum employment and price stability. Evidently dissatisfied with the fulfillment of these goals, some thirty years later Congress passed the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act in 1978 (also known as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act after its two co-authors) that strengthened the original Employment Act. Among other things, the 1978 law mandated that the Federal Reserve should specifically aim to maintain economic growth in line with the economy’s potential to expand. That is, policymakers were instructed to steer the economy in such a way as to insure steady output growth, fast enough to maintain full employment but not so fast as to ignite inﬂation.
w3785|Explaining price differences among related products and among buyers of the same product is a popular pasttime for economists. Is a restaurant's markup on wine higher than on food because wine purchase signals a low demand elasticity for the whole meal or because it indicates a customer who is more costly to serve? Are grocery prices higher in poor neighborhoods than in wealthy ones because the cost of doing business is higher in poor areas or because buyers there are less mobile and less able to switch stores? Until recently, explanations that implied price discrimination often were discounted in markets with easy entry and firms earning normal returns in the long run. That response, however, has become less compelling with the presentation of numerous theoretical models in which price discrimination persists in the markets with multiple firms and even where firms earn zero economic profits.1 This paper analyzes price dispersion in the US airline industry in the context of the recent theoretical advances on competitive price discrimination. We focus on two objectives. First, we wish to quantify the extent of fare inequality in the airline industry and to describe patterns of price dispersion across markets.2 Second, we attempt to distinguish price dispersion due to discriminatory pricing from dispersion that results from variations in costs.3 To meet this objective, we examine the degree to which dis- 1 See Katz, 1984, Borenstein, 1985, and Holmes, 1989.
w3227|The modern approach to labor mobility examines it in two different ways. One approach focuses on explaining the existence of unemployment as a fric-tional phenomenon, a byproduct of labor movements that respond to shifts in the demand for labor in different sectors of the economy. These demand-shifts are in turn the result of shocks to tastes or technology. Lucas and Prescott (1974) provide a theory, and Lilien (1982) applies it to some recent data on unemployment. The work of Long and Plosser (1983) is also a theory of sectoral labor relocation over time that abstracts from unemployment .1 But certain detailed features of mobility itself call for a richer theory. Two such features are (1) that workers tend to move mostly within sectors, not across sectors, and (2) that net labor mobility across sectors appears to be dwarfed by gross mobility -- most moves between sectors cancel out. The model of Jovanovic (1979), extended and estimated with micro data by Miller (1984) and Flinn (1986), was designed to explain such movements of labor. This second approach, however, says nothing about sectoral flows of labor. This paper merges these two views in one model, which is then estimated with data on individuals. This exercise allows us to measure the relative importance of each hypothesis. Moreover, it helps one avoid certain pitfalls.
w7859|The largest country in the world, China, has 1.203 billion inhabitants; the smallest, Palau, has 16,661.' The largest county in the United States (Los Angeles, California) has 8,863,164 inhabitants; the smallest (Loving, Texas) has 107.2 The largest school district in the United States has 1.4 million school-aged children; the smallest has two. Given these enormous differences, a legitimate question is what determines the "optimal" size of political jurisdictions. The answer may be different for different types of jurisdictions-countries, states, counties, school districts, et cetera. In all cases, however, there maybe a tradeoff between the benefits of larger scale and the costs of a more heterogeneous population. Heterogeneity is costly if different individuals have different policy preferences, so that they must compromise in order to share a jurisdiction. Heterogeneity is also costly if individuals prefer to interact with people like themselves. Consider, for example, the problem of dividing an area into school districts.
w0897|The enormous volatility in the prices of capital assets in the American economy has been widely noted. The standard deviation of real stock market returns appears to be about 20 percent per year. Over the last 15 years the price of used capital goods as measured in the stock market relative to consumption goods has varied by a factor of more than two. Comparable volatility is observed in the pricing of used capital goods such as airplanes and office building where an active second-hand market exists. It seems clear that realistic positive or normative analysis of the effects of capital income taxation requires models in which there is substantial scope for variation in the price of capital assets. Yet, the substantial literature on capital income taxes and risk taking has focused almost entirely on models where the return from capital goods is variable but their relative price is certain. This paper reconsiders the effects of taxes on the return from risky assets, recognizing the importance of variations in the price of capital goods. The results suggest that the burden of the corporate income tax is much greater than that implied by analyses such as Gordon (1981) , Stiglitz (1969) and Feldstein (1971), suggesting that it falls primarily on the risk premium on corporate equity. The essential error in earlier analyses is in the treatment of depreciation.
