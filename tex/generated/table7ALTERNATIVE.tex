            \item \textit{Notes}. Sample 1,709 NBER working papers; 1,707 published articles. Estimates exclude 279 pre-internet double-blind reviewed articles (see~\autoref{Footnote51}). Column one displays coefficients on female ratio (\(\beta_{1P}\)) from estimating~\autoref{equation2} directly via OLS (see~\aref{appendixdraftcorr} for coefficients on \(R_{jW}\)); standard errors clustered by editor in parentheses. Columns two and three display \(\wt\beta_{1W}\) and \(\wt\beta_{1W}+\beta_{1P}\) from FGLS estimation of~\autoref{equation6} and ~\autoref{equation7}, respectively; standard errors clusterd by year and robust to cross-model correlation in parentheses. Their difference (\(\beta_{1P}\)) is shown in column four. Column five displays \(\beta_{1P}\) from OLS estimation of~\autoref{equation3}; standard errors clustered by year in parentheses. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^2\) include citation count, \(\text{max. }T_j\) and \(\text{max. }t_j\); \(\text{\ding{51}}^3\) includes \(\text{max. }t_j\), only (see~\autoref{Footnote46}). ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
