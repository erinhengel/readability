            \item \textit{Notes}. Sample 4,289 observations; 1,988 and 1,986 distinct NBER working papers and published articles, respectively; 1,840 distinct authors. Panel one displays magnitude of predicted \(R_{jP}-R_{jW}\) (the contemporaneous effect of peer review) for women and men over increasing publication count (\(t\)). Panel two estimates the marginal effect of an article's female ratio (\(\beta_1+\beta_2\)), separately for draft papers and published articles. Figures from FGLS estimate of~\autoref{equation14}. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^5\) include citation count and \(\text{max. }T_j\). Standard errors clustered by editor and robust to cross-model correlation in parentheses. ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
