            \item \textit{Notes}. Sample 5,216 articles in panel one; 1,900 articles in panel two. Figures represent the marginal effect on female ratio for blinded and non-blinded review from an OLS regression on the relevant readability score. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count and \(\text{max. }T_j\) fixed effects. Standard errors clustered on editor in parentheses. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^3\) includes \(\text{max. }t_j\), only (see~\autoref{Footnote46}). ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
