            \item \textit{Notes}. Sample 9,186 observations (2,827 authors). Figures correspond to the male effects from regression results presented in~\autoref{table5} (first-differenced, IV estimation of~\autoref{equation1}, ~\citet{Arellano1995,Blundell1998}). Effects estimated at a female ratio of zero and observed values for other co-variates. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count and \(\text{max. }T_j\) fixed effects. Regressions weighted by \(1/N_j\); standard errors adjusted for two-way clustering on editor and author (in parentheses).
