            \item \textit{Notes}. Figures correspond to the male effects from regression results presented in~\autoref{table8} (FGLS estimation of ~\autoref{equation1} without lagged dependent variable). First column restricts sample to authors' first publication in the data (\(t=1\)), second column to their second (\(t=2\)), \textit{etc.} Regressions weighted by \(1/N_j\) (see~\autoref{authorlevel}). Standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted for two-way clustering (editor and author) and cross-model correlation. Final column estimates from an unweighted population-averaged regression; error correlations specified by an auto-regressive process of order one and standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted for one-way clustering on author. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count and \(\text{max. }T_j\) fixed effects; \(\text{\ding{51}}^4\) includes citation count, only.
