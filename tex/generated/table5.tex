            \item \textit{Notes}. Sample 9,186 observations (2,827 authors). Figures from first-differenced, IV estimation of~\autoref{equation1}~ \citep{Arellano1995,Blundell1998}. Female ratio (women): contemporaneous marginal effect of a paper's female co-author ratio for female authors (\(\beta_1\)); female ratio (men): analogous effect for male authors (\(\beta_1+\beta_2\)). \textit{z}-statistics for first- and second-order autocorrelation in the first-differenced errors~\citep{Arellano1991}; null hypothesis no autocorrelation. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count and \(\text{max. }T_j\) fixed effects. Regressions weighted by \(1/N_j\); standard errors adjusted for two-way clustering on editor and author (in parentheses). ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
