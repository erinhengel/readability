Figures represent the coefficient on a binary variable equal to 1 for papers entirely female authored and 0 for papers entirely male authored. Papers with both male and female co-authors are excluded. Quality controls denoted by \(\text{\ding{51}}^1\) include citation count and \(\text{max. }T_j\) fixed effects. Standard errors clustered on editor in parentheses. ***, ** and * statistically significant at 1\%, 5\% and 10\%, respectively.
