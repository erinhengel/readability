Figure represents the distribution of the difference (in months) between a paper's release as an NBER Working Paper and submission of that same article to \textit{Econometrica} (where it is eventually published). To the right-hand side of the \(y\)-axis are articles that were released as working papers \textit{after} they they had already been submitted to \textit{Econometrica}. To the left of the \(y\)-axis are articles that were released \textit{first} as an NBER Working Paper and submitted to \textit{Econometrica} at a later date.}
