Flesch Reading Ease marginal mean scores for authors' first, second, third, 4th--5th and sixth and up publications in the data. Solid circles denote estimated readability of NBER working papers from FGLS estimation of~\autoref{equation14}; arrow tips show the estimated readability in published versions of the same papers. Controls are: editor, year, journal, journal and year interactions, English fluency dummies and quality controls (citation count and $\text{max. }T_j$). Regression weighted by $1/N_j$. Pink represents women co-authoring only with other women; blue are men co-authoring only with other men.}
