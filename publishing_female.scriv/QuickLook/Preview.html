<p class="itemText">Women can respond to higher standards in two different ways: immediately (direct effect) and pre-emptively (feedback effect). As emphasised in [][SEUModel], the weight of each effect likely depends on authors' information about---hence experience with---the peer review process. In this section, I illustrate the evolution of the relative importance of each by comparing papers pre- and post-review as authors' publication counts rise.

<p class="itemText">As argued in [][NBER], if field only impacts the readability of a paper when it is first drafted, then the change in readability between versions should not depend on it. For example, using the change in score as the dependent variable should wash out potential bias from, say, concepts in certain areas being easier to explain. Moreover, because FGLS estimates (shown in the final panel of [](#table6_FemRatio)) are almost identical to estimates using the change in readability as the dependent vari...</p>

<p class="itemText">In [][NBER], I argue that the gender gap in the changes in readability between draft and final versions of a paper likely occur because of the peer review process.
