<p class="itemText">As discussed in [][Data], drafts were collected from NBER Technical and Working Paper Series. NBER series were used as the exclusive data source for two reasons. First, approximately one-fifth of articles in the data were originally part of an NBER series, making it the largest single source of draft papers. Second, NBER persistently releases its working papers two to three years before publication (mean 2.1 years)---precisely the length of time spent in peer review[#Ellison2002a,Goldberg2015].</p>

However, NBER has no word limit while two journals in my sample do: *Econometrica* limits abstracts to 150 words; *AER* limits them to 100 words.

<p class="itemText">The following tables repeat the principal analyses from the paper---*i.e.*, those from [](#table4), [](#table5), [](#table7) and [](#table11)---using the R package "readability", an alternative program to calculate the Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog and SMOG readability scores. (The program does not calculate the Flesch Reading Ease or Dale-Chall scores.) As can be seen from the tables, the coefficients are very similar or identical to those presented in the main paper; standard errors are slightly...</p>

<p class="itemText">[](#tableXD) replicates the first four columns of [](#table7) but also includes fixed effects for primary *JEL* category. As discussed in [][NBER], the OLS estimates in the final column of [](#table7) already control for field, assuming the impact of a field on readability is the same in the draft version of a paper as it is in the final, published version. Given this assumption, the almost identical FGLS and OLS estimates presented in [](#table7) already made it pretty clear that field did not ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">NBER working paper release dates vis-à-vis Journal submission dates</p>
<p class="itemText">As shown in [][NBERResults], female-authored papers are more likely to be released as NBER Working Papers *after* the underlying paper was already submitted to *Econometrica*. Here, I show that this conclusion is robust to controlling for year fixed effects. Specifically, I regress the ratio of female authors on the time difference (in months) between a paper's NBER Working Paper release and submission to *Econometrica*. The coefficient on female ratio from this regression is 6.81 months (robust...</p>
