\f0\fs20 \cf0 Another related explanation is that women are more responsive to referee reports. That is, referees are indeed gender neutral but women's interpretation of those reports leads to a general female inclination to write more clearly. This explanation, however, requires the fundamental assumption that women do not allocate their time efficiently. As shown in [][p3duration], female papers take longer in peer review, even after controlling for a large number of contributory factors, including motherhood. Thus, women's conscientiousness has no apparent upside---their papers are not reviewed faster---and a probable downside---diligently responding to every referee's whim and more clearly stating ideas is hard work. In this context, there is simply no rational explanation for women's behaviour---and especially for the behaviour of the profession's most productive female economists who make the largest investments in clear writing.}]]></Comment>
