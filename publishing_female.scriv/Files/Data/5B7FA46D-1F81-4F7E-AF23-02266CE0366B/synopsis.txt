Chapter 1's model implies the following: (i) reducing bankruptcy's impact on future earnings improves financial contracting; but (ii) judicial accuracy has an ambiguous effect. I empirically test both hypotheses using data from a large, cross-country, firm-level survey. I find reorganisation's cost contributes a great deal to perceived financing constraints. Information, on the other hand, appears to have the anticipated ambiguous effect, although data limitations prevent definitively attributing it to the predictions of the model.
