\f0\fs20 \cf0 Technically it is "cash flow insolvent". Another test is "balance sheet insolvency" whereby the firm's liabilities exceed its assets. Usually, balance sheet insolvent firms are also cash flow insolvent; rarely, however, a firm is *currently* able to pay its debts but clearly won't be able to in the future. In this scenario, creditors (or shareholders) can petition the court to declare the company insolvent. Since every balance sheet insolvent firm must eventually be cash flow insolvent, the entrepreneur has no opportunity to misuse company funds and the time value of money is zero, I disregard balance sheet insolvent firms (without loss of generality).}]]></Comment>
