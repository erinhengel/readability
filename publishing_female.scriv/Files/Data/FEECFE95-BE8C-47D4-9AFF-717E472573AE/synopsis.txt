In a comprehensive debt-financing model, I show ``rescue''-centric bankruptcy anticipates motives creditors do not have. Although out-of-court settlements dominate and formal procedures are rarely used, insolvent borrowers nevertheless extract concessions from creditors unless supervised reorganisation is 100 percent free. They pay for it, of course, with inefficient continuation and liquidation, expensive debt and credit-rationing. Ironically, rescue culture hits hardest the firms it purports to save yet benefits creditors, whom it claims to check. Firms with long expected lifespans are either the first denied credit or the first to make investment choices that guarantee premature liquidation. Creditors, on the other hand, enjoy a profitable niche lending market in an otherwise perfectly competitive industry.
