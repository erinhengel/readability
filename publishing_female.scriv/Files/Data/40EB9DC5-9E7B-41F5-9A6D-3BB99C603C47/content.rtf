\f0\fs28 \cf0 The purpose of Condition 2 is subtle. It rules out the possibility that women just intrinsically prefer writing more clearly than men or enjoy a lower cost of writing. Yet any such intrinsic preference or cost explanation defines the minimum readability at which a women is willing to write. Thus, *all* of her papers, including the most poorly written one, is at least this readability level. Because women will always choose a readability level that satisfies this minimum threshold dictated by their preference, any *increase* in readability must be driven by something else---*i.e.*, either their own mis-information or sensitivity or by factors outside their control.}
