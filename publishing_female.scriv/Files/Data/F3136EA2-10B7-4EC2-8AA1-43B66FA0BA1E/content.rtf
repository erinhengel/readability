\f0\fs28 \cf0 As discussed in [][p3authorlevel], [](#p3table6) suggests an increasing, convex relationship between female ratio and readability. The following tables restrict samples to male authors and apply several increasing, convex transformations to female ratio based on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://71B6B755-05D9-49BC-B910-60F795F2018D"}}{\fldrslt [](#p3equationAX).}} The plot of [](#p3equationAX) at different values of $x$ is shown in X; as it illustrates, [](#p3equationAX) assumes little or no relationship between readability and female ratio when few or no co-authors are women; past some threshold, however, the relationship increases exponentially.\
