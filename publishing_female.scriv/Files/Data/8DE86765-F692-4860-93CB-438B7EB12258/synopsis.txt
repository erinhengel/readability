Using five well-known ``readability'' tests, I analyse every article abstract published in the top four economics journals since 1950. I) Abstracts written by women are 1--6 percent more readable than those by men. II) The gap is up to three times higher in published articles than in earlier, draft versions of the same papers. III) Women's writing gradually improves but men's does not---meaning the readability gap grows over authors' careers. I explore many interpretations; the simplest and most persuasive is that referees apply higher standards to women's writing, subjecting them to an added time tax. This last hypothesis is confirmed by submit-accept times at *Econometrica*: female-authored papers take six months longer to complete peer review.
