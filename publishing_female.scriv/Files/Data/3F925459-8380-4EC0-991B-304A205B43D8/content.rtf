\f0\fs28 \cf0 $i$ satisfies the assumptions and conditions of [](#Theorem1) relative to $k$, but that both were suddenly subject to the same standards. How would $i$'s readability choice change? Suppose first $R_\{it''\}\\le R_\{kt\}$ where $R_\{it''\}<R_\{it\}$ was the readability score of one of $i$'s earlier papers (Condition 2). Since it is never optimal for $i$ to set $R_\{it\}$ less than $R_i^\\star$, Condition 2 implies $R_i^\\star<R_\{kt\}$. Thus, holding acceptance rates constant, $i$ prefers $R_\{kt\}$ to any readability score greater than $R_\{kt\}$.\
We therefore know that $i$ does not set $R_\{it\}$ above $R_\{kt\}$. Now suppose $R_\{kt\}\\le R_\{it''\}$. so it might be the case that $R_\{kt\}<R_i^\\star\\le R_\{it''\}$\
and $k$ were subject to identical standards. What readability score would $i$ optimally chose as an experienced author? \
The rough intuition behind [](#eq:correq1) is simple. First, recall that $R_\{it\}=\\widetilde R_i^\{\\bar s\}+e_\{it\}$. Second, note that since every review group that accepts $i$'s paper also accepts $k$'s papers, that must mean that the toughest review group to accept $i$'s papers---*i.e.*, $\\bar s$---also accepts $k$'s papers. Finally, and without loss of generality, suppose $\\bar s$ is also the toughest review group to accept $k$'s paper and that $R_\{kt\}=\\widetilde R_k^\{\\bar s\}+e_\{kt\}$. Thus $R_\{it\}-R_\{kt\}>0$ measures the difference between the readability thresholds applied by group $\\bar s$ to $i$ and $k$:\
<!--\\begin\{align*\}\
R_\{it\}-R_\{kt\}&=\\widetilde R_i^\{\\bar s\}+e_\{it\}-\\widetilde R_k^\{\\bar s\}-e_\{kt\}\\nonumber\\\\\
&=\\widetilde R_i^\{\\bar s\}-\\widetilde R_k^\{\\bar s\}.\
\\end\{align\}-->\
[](#eq:correq1) relaxes the requirement that $\\Sigma_\{A_\{it\}\}\\subset\\Sigma_\{A_\{kt\}\}$. For example, suppose there exists a particularly tough review group $s'$ that applies an identical readability threshold to $i$ and $k$'s papers and, for whatever reason---*e.g.*, $u_k<u_i$---$i$ is willing to work extra hard to appease its demands whereas $k$ isn't. As a result, $s'$ accepts $i$'s papers but rejects $k$'s papers. From [](#Theorem1)'s third condition, however, $i$ and $k$'s average acceptance rates are equal. Thus, there must also exist at least one other review group, call it $s''$ that accepts $k$'s papers but rejects $i$'s papers. In this case, if $R_\{kt\}<R_i^\\star$, then $R_\{it\}-R_\{kt\}$ may over-estimate the impact of tougher standards on his readability choices. Because $R_i^\\star\\le R_\{it''\}$, however, \
then $i$ will likely work harder to appease the demands of a particularly tough group of reviewers. That is, there is at least one review group that accepts $i$'s paper but rejects $k$'s paper. Nevertheless, from [](#Theorem1)'s third condition, we know that $i$ and $k$'s average acceptance rates are equal. Thus, there must also exist at least one other review group that accepts $k$'s but rejects $k$'s papers simply because $k\
Since every review group that accepts $i$'s paper also accepts $k$'s papers, that must mean that the toughest review group to accept $i$'s papers also accepts $k$'s papers. Thus, $\\widetilde R_k^\{\\bar s\}\\le\\widetilde R_\

Additionally, [](#Theorem1) assumes that the more experience a woman gains in peer review, the fewer mistakes she makes about referees' and editors' standards. (Or at least, at some point this becomes true.)\
 the evidence presented in [][Duration] does not support this hypothesis, the test it relies on is very indirect. Moreover, \
that $i$ chooses $R_\{it\}$ to maximise [](#eq:EU). Second, and more importantly, it assumes that $i$ and $k$ write papers write papers that are identical with respect to topic, novelty and quality but potentially differ on readability. Combined, these two assumptions imply $i$ and $k$ do not specialise in different dimensions of quality such that overall quality remains the  with respect to one another. That is, if $i$'s papers are more readable than $k$'s papers, then \
This admits only a very simplified representation of utility which does not, for example, allow authors to trade-off readability for some other aspect of q\

\f1\fs24 \cf0 <!$Scr_Cs::3>
\f0\fs28  tends to infinity---that is, $i$'s beliefs become more accurate as he gains experience in peer review (Assumption 3).\
A limitation of the model is that it only admits a very simplified representation of utility and does not, for example, allow authors to trade off readability for some other aspect of quality such that otherwise identical men and women nevertheless choose to specialise in different aspects. As we showed in Section X, however, it is unlikely that male economists compensate for their lower quality writing by raising quality along another dimension. Nevertheless, this form of specialisation may mitigate the bottom line impact of any gender readability gap observed.\
I emphasis again that the model fully incorporates the idea that authors can and do make mistakes in their beliefs. It assumes, however, that mistakes result from imperfect information (*e.g.*, risk aversion) and/or information asymmetry, in that if we lived in a world with perfect information and zero information asymmetry between the sexes, such "mistakes" would no longer occur. Thus, since "experience" serves as a way to complete information and make it less asymmetric between the sexes, if the readability gap between genders is being caused by these mistaken believes, then the gap should decline with experience. On the other hand, if we observe the opposite trend---*i.e.*, that women *improve* their readability as the uncertainty and the information gap between men and women declines---then we should be hesitant to conclude that gender differences in mistakes (or other internal factors such as intrinsic preferences), even though they very well may be present, especially initially, are in fact driving this particular gap.\

 Assuming preferences are fixed over time, authors improve readability only when they believe more readable papers are more often accepted. And while oversensitivity and/or poor information may distort their beliefs---and in turn affect readability---with experience, they correct those mistakes. Thus, when an experienced author writes more clearly than her inexperienced self, we can conclude that she did so because it really *does* improve her acceptance rates (and not because she was too sensitive or poorly informed). If that same experienced author writes more clearly than an equivalent, experienced male author, *
\f3\i yet
\f0\i0 * her papers are no more likely to be accepted his, *
\f3\i then
\f0\i0 * asymmetric editorial standards and/or biased referee assignment---*
\f3\i i.e.
\f0\i0 *, discrimination---explains the difference.\
The model establishes three conditions sufficient to demonstrate higher standards are present in academic review: (i) experienced women write better than equivalent men; (ii) women improve their writing over time; and (iii) female-authored papers are accepted no more often than equivalent male-authored papers. I empirically test (i) and (ii) among well-published economists. \
As a final exercise, I also document evidence that higher standards increase the cost to women of producing a paper and likely lower their observed productivity. The data also suggest that women respond to higher standards by *
\f3\i conforming
\f0\i0 * to those standards in ways that may make it difficult to distinguish biased treatment from voluntary choice.\
\
Moreover, higher standards may manifest themselves in more indirect ways. In particular, I find suggestive evidence that women increasingly submit better written papers *
\f3\i ex ante
\f0\i0 * to offset biased evaluation *
\f3\i ex post
\f0\i0 *. Thus, the readability gap between senior economists largely forms prior to---therefore appearing independent of---peer review. This pattern of behaviour suggests women internalise tougher standards with strategies that, perversely, may end up disguising them as voluntary choice and may therefore contribute to a host of labour market phenomena: sectoral and occupational concentration, a tendency to under-negotiate pay and greater reluctancy to compete against men.\

I can only attribute women's behaviour to higher standards if the submission and revision decisions of experienced economists of both sexes adhere to [#Savage1954;]'s axioms of rationality. If they are violated for women---but not men---my results suggest female economists who are very experienced in the peer review process nevertheless engage in actions which limit their career advancement relative to men's (see [][Discussion] for a discussion). As a result, policies which target external (as opposed to internal) factors may still be more effective at increasing the representation of women in top journals [for a discussion in a related context, see\\]\\[][#Born2019].

\f0\fs28 In the present paper, I do not explore the particular relationship between review time and readability. Superficial correlations between the two are almost certainly confounded by unobserved heterogeneity in submission quality.

\f0\fs28 . It is undoubtedly easier to remedy most issues surrounding readability than it is to fix actual, major flaws. Thus, the unbiased relationship between readability and review time is impossible to obtain without controlling for submission quality or placing significant structure on the data generating process. This is beyond the scope of the present {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E44F07F7-C99E-4C06-83B0-CCF8485F2747"}}{\fldrslt paper.}}\

Although these findings strongly suggest editorial/refereeing bias play a role, they cannot definitively rule out that women simply write better papers---*e.g.*, because they're more sensitive to referee criticism. \

\cf0 Assuming men and women are equally capable researchers, this means women have adopted a strictly dominated publication strategy.\
But if men and women were equally capable economists, then why would women adopt this dominated strategy?\
Because women *don\'92t* adopt men's strategy despite its better outcomes suggests the cost of employing it relative to the one they do employ is much higher for them than it would be for men. Meaning women are worse economists than men are.\
Women would only opt for this costlier strategy because the one employed by men and achieves similar (or better) outcomes with less work and is, in fact, much costlier for women to employ than it is for men. Implying of course that women are worse economists than men.\
\
The only reason women would choose to employ a costlier strategy that results in worse outcomes is if a less costly option with similar or better outcomes were not available to them---*
\f3\i i.e.
\f0\i0 *, only if they are worse economists than men are.\
\
The publication strategy men have chosen to employ---whatever it is---results in similar (or higher) acceptance rates and shorter reviews.\
Nevertheless, because they have no relative advantage in acceptance rates and longer peer review times this must indirectly imply that women are worse economists than men. The issue is that the writing/math strategy employed by men results in similar (or higher) acceptance rates and shorter review times. Thus, the fact that women don\'92t adopt this strategy implies the cost of employing it relative to the one they do employ is much higher for women than it is for men. The only reason women would choose to employ a costlier strategy that results in worse outcomes is if a less costly option with similar or better outcomes were not available to them---*

[#Knowles2001;] endogenises the behaviour and choices of people discriminated against in a model of racial profiling in police stops.

To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to explicitly model the *learning process* of people being discriminated against and use that to identify discrimination. (So others have endogenised the impact of discrimination on behaviour; and used the learning behaviour of those who discriminate; I'm the first to use the impact of discrimination on the behaviour of people being discriminated against to identify discrimination.)

In the next section, discuss why t-varying factors could distort the selection of pairs that satisfy Condition 2 conditional on pairs that aready satisfy Condition 1.\
\
Perhaps women would rather write more clearly at t=1, but co-author characteristics are holding them back. So, for example, they co-authored their first publications with men, so that's why they were more poorly written. Once they got more experience, they wrote on their own and that's when they wrote more clearly. Yet, women are more likely to solo-author or author with other women at t=1 than they are at t=3. Women are more likely to solo-author---or co-author with women---at t=1 than they are at t=3.\
\
\\fi\
-->\
\
First, in an earlier version of this paper, I controlled for these factors (as well as the endogenous factors described above) but \
each person in the matched sample would, ideally, solo-author his first and third publication in the same year and publish it in the same journals. Then $R_\{i3\}-R_\{i1\}$ would capture the impact $i$'s experience has on readability, conditional on gender; $R_\{i3\}-R_\{k3\}$ would reflect the impact of gender, conditional on experience. Unfortunately, the sample is too small to restrict it to just those observations that satisfy these criteria. In order to perform the analysis on a meaningful sample, I therefore created counterfactual observations $\\widehat R_\{it\}$ to account for time varying factors---including co-author characteristics---that might influence readability.\
This procedure may have introduced bias in one of two ways. First, if co-author characteristics are not properly accounted for my estimates might be biased by peer effects. Second, if I have not properly accounted for time varying factors, then they , in turn, may be driving the results. This latter concern is a general concern for all of the estimates generated in this paper---*i.e.*, have I properly controlled for all factors that affect readability and correlate with gender---and discuss in more detail in [][Discussion].\
The former concern could be tested by looking only at non-co-authored papers or papers predominately co-authored by women. [][AppendixExclusive ], [](#table8XC) reproduces [](#table8) on the sample of papers exclusively authored by women. Again, all figure agree: women write better and the magnitude and significance of that difference increases as $t$ increases.\

Nevertheless, the journals one submits to, the fields one gravitates toward and the people with whom one chooses to co-author are all endogenously determined by an author's experience. Higher standards, once uncovered, are potentially met by manipulating any of these variables. As a result, accounting for

That is, accounting for $t$-varying factors under $i$'s control potentially biases estimates of Condition 1, thus distorting selection of pairs that satisfy Condition 2 conditional on satisfying Condition 1. See [](#Footnote92) and the following robustness section for further discussion on this point.\
\
Hence, my over all estimate of $D_\{ik\}$ would be potentially biased by including pairs for which $R_\{i3\}-R_\{k3\}$ is positive---*i.e.*, a gender gap between matched pairs exists---but $R_\{i3\}-R_\{i1\}$ is positive not because author $i$ learned that readability leads to higher acceptance rates, but because of some exogenously determined factor I do not account for.

\f0\fs28  papers aren't constant across pairs. To account for this, I estimate the following equation via OLS in the four distinct time- and gender-specific samples of authors:\
\
R_\{it\}$.\
$$\\widehat R_\{it\}=\\beta_\{0tg_i\}+\\beta_\{1tg_i\}\\,\\text\{female\}_i+\\varepsilon_\{it\},$$\
 where $text\{female\}_i$ is 1 if $i$ is female, 0 if male and $\\teta_\{tg_i\}^\{\\text\{\\textit\{AER\}\}\} is the time- and gender-specific coefficient on the *AER* dummy variable, chosen because the majority of paper are published in that journal.\
If $\\widehat R_\{i3\}-\\widehat R_\{i1\}$ is positive, then experience has taught$i$ to write more clearly. Indeed, even if the effect is largely driven by co-author characteristics or the choice of journal or field in which to publish, experience has nevertheless taught $i$ to publish in those journals, concentrate in those fields and co-author with people that demand clearer writing---*because doing so generates a higher acceptance rate*.\
Similarly, if $i$ and $k$ are equivalent authors of the opposite gender and $\\widehat R_\{i3\}-\\widehat R_\{k3\}$ are positive, then conditional on journal, $i$'s papers are more readable. But then, if $\\widehat R_\{i3\}-\\widehat R_\{i1\}$ is positive, too, then experience has taught $i$ to generate more readable papers *and* $i$ *does* write more readable papers than author $k$ yet her acceptance rate is no higher than his, then experience has taught her to perform an activity that is not rewraded the same between genders.\
Indeed, it could be driven by a multitude of factors---but the fact remains that at $t=3$, $i$ writes more readably than $k$.\

I would ideally account for this by restricting the sample to authors to who write their $t=1$ and $t=3$ papers on their own. $R_\{i3\}-R_\{i1\}$ then captures experience's impact on readability holding gender and author fixed (Condition 2); $R_\{i3\}-R_\{k3\}$ is gender's impact on readability holding experience and author equivalence fixed (Condition 1). Unfortunately, this sample is small: only ten women solo-authored their $t=1$ and $t=3$ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://40023D4D-819E-4A60-92AE-E53ACF2DA680"}}{\fldrslt papers.}}\
Nevertheless, the most obvious way co-author characteristics could distort the results is if women are more likely to co-author with other women as $t$ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://8BEC7153-3CC8-4602-BE93-4E25E2774841"}}{\fldrslt increases,}} so the subsample of authors with $t=1$ and $t=3$ papers at least 50 percent co-authored by women may be the more relevant sample. Results using this subsample are available in [][Appendix50percent] and support the conclusions I present.\
I present here a more parsemonious model to account for factors that vary with $t$, which, in addition to co-author characteristics include female ratio, journal, year and steroetypes about authors' institutions.\

\f0\fs28 : female ratio, journal, year, field, co-author characteristics and stereotypes about authors' institutions. Nevertheless, the first goal is to isolate the impact of experience on her choice of readability. And indeed, her choice of journal in which to submit her paper, field in which to concentrate and co-authors to publish with are endogenously determined by her experience---she will gravitate towards those values which increase her acceptance rate. Thus, even if the effect is largely driven by co-author characteristics or the choice of journal or field in which to publish, experience has nevertheless taught $i$ to publish in those journals, concentrate in those fields and co-author with people that demand clearer writing---*because doing so generates a higher acceptance rate*.\
For that reason, I only account for the subset of time-varying factors which authors must take as given---in this case, year of publication and the female ratio of the paper.\
In the interest of clarity, brevity and accuracy, I opt for a parsemonious model that accounts for a subset of these factors, only. It is generated by \

Unfortunately, the sample is too small to restrict it to just those observations that satisfy these criteria. \
In a dynamic model of authors\'92 decision-making processes, I show that any gap caused exclu- sively by (i) or (ii) declines with experience. Yet the gap does not decline. It widens. Estimates from pooled subsamples and matching indicate women write more clearly as their publication count increases; men, possibly less so. This pattern of behaviour suggests discrimination\'97either directly in the form of biased referee scrutiny or indirectly from biased referee assignment (The- orem 1).\

\f1\fs24 \cf0 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f0\fs28 Using readability measures, I show that female-authored papers *become* more readable relative to male-authored papers precisely during the time that they are undergoing peer review. Assuming timing independence, this result suggests that the peer review process is responsible for the gap.\
Why does peer review cause women to write more clearly? There are two possible explanations. Either women voluntarily write better papers \'96 for example, because they\'92re more sensitive to referee criticism or overestimate the importance of writing well \'96 or better written papers are women\'92s response to higher standards imposed by referees and/or editors.\
Both explanations imply women spend too much time rewriting old papers and not enough time writing new papers. However, my evidence suggests the latter is primarily to blame. To show this, I model an author's decision-making process over time.\

The purpose of this study is to test whether women are held to higher standards in academic peer review using an objective---but narrow---measure of research quality---readability. \

This paper makes a curious discovery: female-authored articles in top economics journals are better written. This gap widens precisely while the papers are undergoing peer review as well as over a woman's lifetime. A dynamic model of an author's decision-making process shows that tougher editorial standards and/or biased referee assignment are the only explanations consistent with women's choices. Using a conservative measure derived from the model, I estimate that this type of discrimination causes senior female economists to write at least 9 percent more clearly than they otherwise would.\
After examining the difference, I conclude that higher standards applied by editors and/or referees are primarily to blame.\
No prior study has uncovered convincing evidence of gender bias in journal acceptance rates. It's encouraging that sex is irrelevant to publication outcomes, but that does not mean it has no effect on the process---or on the productivity of female academics. When female authors endure unfair criticism in referee reports, clearer writing and longer review times follow. With less time to spend on new projects, research output slows down.\

Measurement error in the dependent variable could partially correlate with a paper's share of female authors due to factors unrelated to higher standards.

In this case, interpreting gender differences shifts from "women are better writers" to "women use simpler words and shorter {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://F6FADC08-9476-4D3F-82B1-06443F046277"}}{\fldrslt sentences".}} The conclusions I derive from the analyses mapped out in this paper , however, should remain valid.\

But why? There is no obvious, non-cognitive reason *why* women should use simpler words, write shorter sentences and, especially, *behave according to the patterns mapped out in this paper*---other than higher writing standards for female-authored work.\
the conclusions I derive from the analyses mapped out in this paper should remain valid.\
conclusions derived from it remain inescapable\
Thus, the inescapable conclusions---women use simpler wrods and write shorter sentencies conditioning on co-variates, *including field*, and that increases over their careers---\
Since the analysis mapped out in this paper applies irrespective of one's precise interpretation of the dependent variable, \
the conclusion remains inescapable: women use simpler words and write shorter sentences conditioning on co-variates, *

\
That leaves us with a final, straightforward alternative.\
But what other reason would induce female economists to employ shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary conditioning for reasons that are independent of a desire to write more readably? Not because they research topics that use simpler words---including field controls has little effect. Maybe men just happened to use simple yet polysyllabic words? But then we should consequently observe no effect using the Dale-Chall score, which measures vocabulary complexity using a predefined word list.\
A final alternative is rather uncomfortable. Perhaps female-authored manuscripts just aren't as good? \

\f1\fs24 \cf0 Similarly, female research is more provocative, and more provocative work warrants more scrutiny. Nevertheless, if this were true, controlling for *
\f4\i JEL
\f1\i0 * classification would also reduce (or eliminate) the gap---unless women's work is systematically more provocative even among researchers in very narrow fields. There is some evidence for this hypothesis---provocative work is (presumably) highly cited work and contemporary female-authored work tend to be cited more[#Hengel2018]. Yet more provocative work that is also highly cited should also probably be published at higher rates---and there's no evidence women's papers are accepted more than men's[#Ceci2014]. Alternatively, perhaps the wider public excessively scrutinises female work, and referees respond similarly to minimise blowback. This explanation assumes a wider public capable of discrediting our work---a view many economists would (privately) disagree with. In any case, economics employs advanced mathematics and technical language, making it especially inaccessible to a layperson.
\f0\fs28 \
Nevertheless, this *still* implies a systematic inability by editors to appropriately assign relevant referees to female-authored papers. And again, that's bias.\
\
it is still observed that sentences are shorter and vocabulary less complex in female-authored papers, conditional on the co-variates of control. And indeed, the weighted average of these two variables is informative in much the same way that the general "readability inference is. Conditioning on the control variables, there is no obvious reason why \
Indeed, I cannot think of a good reason why, after controlling for all of the factors that I do---including *JEL* controls---female-authored papers should employ shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary for reasons that don't involve higher standards, female irrationality or some explanation involving the general lower quality of female-authored work that somehow isn't picked up by the plethora of co-variates I include to account for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://FBEBC9EB-690F-4606-9F38-C12BD7DB637E"}}{\fldrslt it.}}\
Underlying the conclusions presented in this paper is the implicit assumption that if some perfect measure of readability existed, then the difference between that measure and the readability scores I use in the analysis does not partially correlate with gender.\
As I describe in [][Calculation], there are plenty of reasons why this might break down. Moreover, I discuss in some detail the effort I have taken to minimise the three primary sources of this error.\
In [][Calculation], I describe the effort I have taken to minimise the thre primary sources of non-classical measurement error: (a) grammatical, spelling and transcription errors in the textual input; (b) errors in the estimates of vocabulary complexity and sentence length introduced by automating their calculation; or (c) embodied in the jump from using these two variables to infer readability.\
\
The readability of text may be more important when interest is low than when it is high[#Klare1976,Fass1978]. It has also been shown that prior knowledge and beliefs about a topic improved reading comprehension for a particular text[#Woern1977,Spilich1979,Chiesi1979]. Easier readability of a text has more benefits for those of less knowledge and interest than those of more. Advanced knowledge of a subject can "drown out" the effects of an otherwise difficult text. This study also suggested that when reader interest is high, comprehension is not improved by writing the material below, rather than at, the grade level of the readers. When interest is low, however, comprehension is improved by writing the materials below, rather than at, the reading level of the readers.\
\
\
 referees' lack of knowledge and interest in female-authored work. But then why aren't editors doing a better job of matching female-authored work to referees that are actually interested in---and knowledgable about---that work?\
Nevertheless, the readability gap remains after controlling for detailed *JEL* codes. Thus, this must mean that referees are systematically less interested in women's work even after controlling for highly specific sub-fields. That is, male-authored papers are more appealing to editors and referees even compared to female-authored papers in the exact same field. This suggests a systematic bias against women in peer review that---although not the *fault* of individual referees---nevertheless reflects gender bias stemming from the systematic underrepresentation of women in economics.\

TO ADD:\
Readability scores may be capturing something not related to readability.\

\f1\fs24 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f0\fs28 Thus underlying all of the conclusions presented in this paper is the implicit assumption that if some perfect measure of readability existed that incorporated these factors, it would conclude the same thing. Thus assumption implies that the effects presented in this paper suffer from attenuation {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://7DF9D7D1-2F02-4C8E-9036-1C6825F5D2B7"}}{\fldrslt bias.}} given the relatively large textual samples used in the paper, the effects presented in fact suffer from attenuation bias.\
Because readability scores omit these factors using them to infer causality between gender and any outcome they attempt to proxy for implicitly assumes that gender impacts these other facets in the same way that gender impacts readability. Or, in other words, if we *did* have a more comprehensive measure of readability, it would show the same thing.\
And in any case, readability scores are perfect (or almost perfect) predictors of sentence and word length. Thus, the figures presented in this paper will always capture differences in the weighted averages of these two measures.\

*Discuss classicial measurement error vs. non-classical measurement error*.\
Classical measurement error is of most concern in small sample sizes with a high degree of variability between individuals because higher weights are placed on individual results. While I cannot rule out classical measurement error entirely as a factor driving my results, the fact that sample sizes are both relatively large and results do not appear to be driven by any individual results, suggests it is probably not, on its own, a particularly important factor.\
\
\
Thus, if non-classical measurement error prevents inferring gender differences in *readability* it is still the case that sentence-length and vocabulary complexity in female-authored papers is negatively affected by peer review. \
Thus, should non-classical measurement error prevent inferring readability between genders, one must nevertheless confront the observation that sentence-length and vocabulary complexity in female-authored papers is negatively affected by peer review. \
The weighted average of these two variables is informative in much the same way that the general "readability" inference may be.\
\
Negative values are papers released as working papers first and submitted to peer review second. These are the observations for which timing independence may have been violated. Pink represents papers with at least one female author; blue are papers with no female authors.\

\f0\fs28 Additionally, most drafts have been widely circulated prior to NBER Working Paper release. The average length of the acknowledgement section in NBER Working Papers is 133 words. Most authors thank at least one person for helpful comments---the vast majority thank several---and mention having previously presented the research in conferences and seminars. Combined with evidece from [](#figure7) , this suggests that gender differences in non-peer-review feedback only affect a paper's readability *

Preliminary regressions suggest that substantial declines in readability are correlated with longer review times, particularly for women. A possible explanation for this inverted relationship is that these papers contained actual, major flaws. Thus, their content meaningfully changed between draft and final versions but ensuring revised text is readable is not a primary concern because more serious issues took precedence.

As shown in [](#table6), female-authored NBER abstracts tend to be slightly longer (more words) than male-authored abstracts---but then slightly shorter (again, in terms of total words) in published form.

The graph on the left displays abstract length in NBER working papers; the graph on the right displays the distribution of abstract lengths in the published paper, again broken down by gender. Word counts in NBER drafts are more spread out; they are much more tightly compacted in the final, published version of those same papers.

referees may be more likely to focus on readability issues in papers with few structural issues.\
Thus, \
\
correlations between readability and review time will produce biased results. Indeed, initial regressions suggest this may be the case---papers that *decline* the most in readability spend the *longest* in peer review---suggesting their content has changed substantially between draft and final version but no particular effort has been made to ensure the changed text is readable.

At the heart of every identification strategy is some behaviourial assumption of how the participants have reacted to discrimination. In the Petra Todd study, they assume that agents immediately and optimally adjust the amount of contraband they carry to react to police search rates. In the Kleven study they assume fertility decisions are independent of earnings (and therefore discrimination).\
\
This comparison would then not only recover whether discrimination actually existed, but also the precise magnitude of its effect.\
There are two treatments. Peer review and gender. Peer review happens to everyone, but we can compare the within person readability response. So we see everyone's readability pre-treatment 1 and post-treatment 1.\
But gender is the second treatment. Being female does not happen to everyone. So we can only compare the non-treated sample with the treated sample.\
A finding that minority searches are systematically less productive than white searches is accordingly evidence that police require less probable cause when searching minorities. Such evidence would suggest that if police required the same level of probable cause when searching minorities as when searching whites, there would be fewer minorities searched (or proportionally more whites searched).\
Disparate treatment tests are normally tests of decision making on the margin, but real world data at times only allows researchers to assess infra-marginal effects.\

The way individuals who experience discrimination respond to it distorts test of discrimination at the margin. It may be that earlier experiences that people have and the way they respond to it means that the individual-specific marginal effect we think we are observing is in fact an individual-specific infra-marginal effect.\
If either the decision or the outcome is nondichotomous, it is easier for the researcher to identify the marginal effects. If referees are setting continuous readability thresholds, then we can directly test the marginal impact of their decision. The referees' ability to individually vary the threshold in a sense makes every paper marginal, and therefore avoids the infra-marginal problem that has plagued the application of outcome tests to the mortgage context.\
The people who are below the margin---and so would get in regardless of affirmative action---are below the margin for historical reasons.\
Similarly, if the outcome itself is nondichotomous, it may be easier to identify whether the threshold decisionmaking is discriminatory. Thus, for example, in the citation studies, researchers in measuring the number of citations given to articles written by women and men can assess not just the average level of success but can estimate the entire distribution of sucess. By analysing this distribution, it may be possible to identify whether the editors in making acceptance decisions systematically demand more or fewer expected citations in accepting the marginal (least likely cited) articles of minority authors.\
\
The (false) finding of no racial bias using standard OLS specifications suggests that recent attempts to measure judge decisions using machine learning algorithms could be biased by these issues.\
Moreover, our finding that bail judges are monolithic in their treatment of white and black defendants and, as a result, that there is no relative racial bias in bail setting, highlights the importance of developing empriical tests that can detect absolute racial bias.\
male and female draft readability scores for first-time publications are exactly the same, suggesting both start out with identical beliefs. Yet identical beliefs to not promise identical information. \

A second issue is that readability scores are only as accurate as the underlying text fed into them.

While all of these components are indeed important for determining readability, the few measures developed to capture them are also highly correlated with readability {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://86B948F6-F0EA-4907-83CA-4D64D856D97E"}}{\fldrslt scores.}} Nevertheless, as imperfect measures of "readability", to be interpreted as such requires confronting the issue of measurement {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://6BEA3505-78D5-4A73-9B2B-4C7D09784D80"}}{\fldrslt error.}}\

Using readability scores in this manner has several important advantages. First, researcher subjectivity is avoided. Hundreds of readability scores exist, each employing slightly different methodology to analyse the readability of a piece of text. I simply choose the five most common measures. Moreover, although it is possible (probable?) that one of the underlying components of readability scores is truly driving nay observed gender differences, there is no prior research to pinpoint which one that would be. Using the overarching score, meanwhile, incorporates both measures. This will obviously come at a cost (in terms of noise) if one of the underlying components is truly driving gender differences in readability; but the benefit is reduced researcher subjectivity.\
\
I do not indent to use readability as a proxy for the overall quality of a paper. Instead, I look at readability after controlling for other components---citations, author institution---that reflect (or are a consequence of) the quality of the underlying paper. That is, holding everything constant, what is the marginal difference in readability of male and female-authored papers? \
these readability scales only work as supplementary tools for a text where language proficiency is already confirmed through other means.\
These scores are only approximations of reading difficulty and the educational/intellectual level your audience might need to understand your work. They are obviously not indicators of writing quality or how well your writing will be received by your target audience. I would say that a work with such low readability scores and such long sentences (26 for 1200 words?) is likely to come off as too obscure or elitist to the general reader, and would have a very limited audience. But, of course, such things are a matter of taste and convention. So ultimately, this is just my personal opinion.\
Of course, readability formuals are not perfect predictors of readability. Evidence suggests they may not be accurate enough to adequately assess or guide development of individual documents, including legal briefs[#Sirico2007], financial disclosure documents[#Loughran2014] or school reading material[#Ardoin2005, Powell-Smith2001]. But any measure used in quantitative analysis to an extent suffers from this criticism. Unemployment status is a noisy predictor of an individual's future employment situtation, but aggregated over many individuals, it more accurately predicts how easy it is to get a job in a particular geographic unit. IQ scores are likely a noisy predictor of one person's intelligence---but are more accurate when aggregated over larger samples. The PISA score is a noisy measure of the educational atainment of a particular country. But---as with readability scores---each of these measures do correlate with the outcome of interest.\
However, the use of certain quantitative measures is well established in research. Thus, the process of---and therefore trust in---data collection is more mature. Textual analysis, on the other hand, is still a developing field, with few discipline-specific norms for measuring inputs and selecting methods used to address a given empirical issue.\
It has been claimed that traditional tests of reading difficulty "are dubious instruments for adequately assessing the readability of accounting narratives that are adjust oriented and specialist in nature."[p. 172\\]\\[][#Jones1994]. Yet this criticism was aimed at using readability scores to assess the readability of *specific* texts---*i.e.*, readability scores may not be precise enough to determine if a specific financial disclosure document is sufficiently clear or if a particular book is appropriate for certain grade-levels.\
Yet while the margin for error in each individual case may be large, readability scores nevertheless *do* correlated with writing clarity, making them appropriate measures to estimate gender differences when sample sizes are sufficiently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://81360368-C9FC-4945-9F14-935229CE3769"}}{\fldrslt large.}} Just like saying the U.K. has a stronger economy than France because it has a higher estimated GDP per capita is less certain than making the more general claim that countries with higher GDP per capita have, on average, stronger economies than countries with lower GDP per capita. Similarly, the statement "Finland has a better education system because it earns a higher PISA score" is less certain than the statement\

I do not indent to use readability as a proxy for the overall quality of a paper. Instead, I look at readability after controlling for other components---citations, author institution---that reflect (or are a consequence of) the quality of the underlying paper. That is, holding everything constant, what is the marginal difference in readability of male and female-authored papers? Yet, although the purpose of this paper is just to show that women are better writing, it would be nice to see that better writing in female-authored papers is associated with other positive quality outcomes.

Specifically, readability scores only measure the "surface features" of text and ignore other features such as content, organisation, coherence and human interest as well as features of the layout such as font, spacing, the prevalence of relevant figures and graphics and reader interest are all important components of reading comprehension ignored by the formulas.\
Thus, adaptions and revisions of texts by mechanically lowering readability scores can result in less readable text. Also, reduced cohesion may be brought about by mechanically shortening sentences. Thus, classifying text by readability scores comes with all the same problems of classifying intelligence using IQ tests, or biases using implicit bias tests or really anything using supervised machine learning texts. Thus, applying readability scores in academic research comes with similar cautions.\
Yet, despite the success of readability formulas, they remain controversial. Critics of the formulas typically concentrate on three main criticisms. First, one limitation of the formulas is that they do, indeed, contain only \'93surface features\'94 of text and ignore other features like content and organisation. The research shows, however, that these surface features\'97the readability variables\'97with all their limitations have remained the best predictors of text difficulty as measured by comprehension tests (Hunt 1965, Bormuth 1966, Maxwell 1978, Coupland 1978, Kintsch and Miller 1981, Chall 1984, Klare 1984, Davison 1984 and 1986, Carver 1990, Chall and Conard 1991, Chall and Dale 1995).\

Second, some critics contend that the readability formulas were developed for children and they never were never formulated or tested with technical documents. This is actually incorrect. All five formulas were originally developed to assess the reading difficulty of adult reading material[#Dubay2004,Vieth1988;]. For example, Klare (1952) tested the Flesch Reading Ease and Dale-Chall formulas against the 16 standardised passages of reading comprehension tests developed for adult readers. Several extensive studies (Klare et al. 1955a, Klare et al. 1957, Klare and Smart 1973, Caylor et al. 1973, Kincaid et al. 1975, Hooke et al. 1979) used materials developed for technical training and regulations in the military to formulate and test several of today\'92s most popular formulas such as the Flesch-Kincaid grade-level formula. A series of studies in the military (Klare et al. 1955a) examined how prior knowledge as well as the text variables affect the retention and the acceptability of technical documents. more readable versions resulted in: Greater and more complete retention. Greater amount read in a given time. Greater acceptability (preference).\

\f1\fs24 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f0\fs28 Additionally, as shown in [][Abstracts], NBER abstracts---both those by men and women---change significantly in readability between draft and final version. As I show in [][NBER], drafts are typically released as NBER working papers *after* they were already submitted to peer review (and this is especially true for female-authored papers). Since post-submission, authors probably do not solicit non-referee feedback nor make non-referee requested changes. Thus, these changes in both male and female-authored papers probably do reflect the peer review process.\

The Flesch Reading Ease scales from 0 (hard) to 100 (easy). In contrast, the other four scores generate grade levels estimating the minimum years of schooling necessary to confidently understand an evaluated text---and so lower scores indicate easier-to-read text. To minimise confusion, I multiply the four grade-level scores by negative one. Thus, higher numbers universally correspond to clearer writing throughout the paper.\
Moreover, some authors have proposed methods they consider to be better estimates of readability. [#Benoit2017;] proposes X; [#Loughran2014;] proposes X, *etc.* While all of these studies criticise one or more traditional measures of readability---and propose new, alternative measures of the readability of complex documents---they also, universally, confirm that traditional metrics of readability do indeed correlate with the actual readability of a particular piece of text.\

The role of readability is also considered important as a central or adjunct variable in assessing financial documents. The empirical results of several studies studies repeatedly document a statistical association between a traditional readability measure and other attributes of the firm. The first paper to examine the link between annual report readability and firm performance for a meaningful sample is [#Li2008;]. He measures the readability of annual reports using the Gunning Fog Index and the number of words contained in the annual report. He finds that firms with lower reported earnings tend to have annual reports that are harder to read (*i.e.*, high Fog Index values or high word counts). He also finds that companies with more readable annual reports have higher earnings persistence. Other researchers have also used the Gunning Fog Index as a measure of annual report readability. [#Biddle2009;] find that firms with high reporting quality (using the Gunning Fog Index and two other variables) are associated with greater capital investment efficiency. [#Guay2015;] find that companies with less readable annual reports (based on six different readability measures, including the Gunning Fog Index) tend to mitigate this negative readability effect by issuing more managerial forecasts of earnings per share, sales and cash flows. [#Miller2010;] finds that small investors trade significantly fewer shares of firms with high Fog Index values and word counts (*i.e.*, less readable annual reports) around the 10-K filing date. Less readable annual reports should be harder to process especially for less-sophisticated {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://8BDF0E20-8C1F-4F63-A7B1-ADE47C0EF3B2"}}{\fldrslt investors.}} Other studies have found that readable business documents are linked to lower analyst dispersion and greater earnings forecast accuracy[#Lehavy2011], higher trading volumn[#DeFranco2015] and stronger analyst reactions to both good and bad news[#Rennekamp2012;]. Other studies have shown that investors are more likely to invest in firms with shorder, more readable 10-Ks[#Lawrence2013], and firms with more readable documents have more pronouced small investor trading activity around the filing date [#Miller2010].\

Likewise, [#Owens2011;] and [#Spriggs1996;] examine the complexity of Supreme Court decisions, pointing to the importance of clarity in court opinions. In the context of the British parliament, [#Spirling2016;] applies readability measures to document the democratising effects of franchise reform on elite speeches. Studying post-war Austrian and German elections, [#Bischof2018;] find that simpler manifestos make for better informed voters.\

This decision was made on the assumption that a gender readability gap---if it exists---is function of (i) the probability a particular portion of analysed text was written and/or revised by a female co-author; and (ii) referees' beliefs about female authors' contributions to the writing of a paper. I assume the intersection of (i) and (ii) is positively related to the ratio of female authors on a paper. This assumption is supported by prior research suggesting that co-authors---regardless of seniority---tend to share responsibility for writing and revising collaborative work{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A6093454-E3E3-4E9A-AB83-C0CF66BA8284"}}{\fldrslt

Early statistical validity of readability scores was established by applying the formulas to passages of text that had previously been ranked according to difficulty based on the average reader's ability to correctly answer several comprehension questions after reading it. All scores correlate highly with these tests: 0.64--0.70. Later studies confirmed their validity using the cloze procedure{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://9BA45E82-CD46-40E5-8430-D6A16D8CF2F2"}}{\fldrslt [for a detailed and extensive overview of this research, see\\]\\[][#Klare1975].}} Other studies have also validated readability scores against the judgement of both expert and non-expert human judgement, oral fluency tests and other readability scores. In general, readability scores are highly correlated with other readability rescores; they also exhibit a strong association with rankings provided by human judgement. Their correlations with measures of oral reading fluency---e.g., the number of words read correctly aloud per minute---are positive, but more moderate[#Begeny2014,Ardoin2005].\
\
 [#Bormuth1966;] found cloze scores correlated highly with all the individual comopnents of readability scores used in this analysis (syllables per word, sentence length, *etc.*). This study also provided evidence that the correlation between formula variables and comprehension do not change as a function of reading ability. These studies continued to show strong statistical correlation between readability scores and writing clarity\
\
The constants in each formula vary widely as do the components used to rank vocabulary. The Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid scores rely on syllable count. Gunning Fog and SMOG total polysyllabic words (words with three or more syllables). Dale-Chall tallies words not on a pre-defined list of 3,000 so-called "easy" {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://99A63E63-2F9B-4007-BF2F-3C7F439D433F"}}{\fldrslt words.}} Because of these differences, the four grade-level scores rarely generate identical figures; nevertheless, all five scores produce roughly equivalent rankings(for a review of literature supporting this conclusion, see, [][AppendixMetaAnalysis]).\

The tests were supposed to teach children how to comprehend many different kinds of reading materials, how to enjoy reading, and how to be motivated and to improve expressing themselves orally. They were called "standard" test lessons because every test would show "how well the normal or typical pupil would read these same lessons" (McCall and Crabbs 1925,\
184).\
The estimated coefficient of correlation of his measure, the Flesch Reading Ease score, with a benchmark measure of text comprehension---the McCall-Crabbs *Standard Test Lessons*---was 70 percent.\
\
\
\
More recent research using other benchmark measures of text comprehension have backed this earlier evidence up. One of the oldest and most commonly used formulas, the Dale-Chall has consistently proven to be a reliable formula for gauging general text difficulty for higher ability readers[#Begeny2014,Hintz2004]. [#Ardoin2005;] find a modest relationship between reading fluency and the four grade-level readability scores, and especially strong evidence in favour of the Gunning Fog readability {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://C758B4BF-AB79-4367-8E09-4F44EB331D7B"}}{\fldrslt measure.}}\
\
Other studies have shown that the Flesch Reading Ease accurately---albeit noisily---gauges the readability of sophisticated political discourse[#Beniot2017;], although the correlations they reported are more muted than those found in earlier {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://71FD6E02-B0B3-4609-A2B3-55935DBBE987"}}{\fldrslt studies.}}\

The most popular reading comprehension test was the McCall-Crabbs *Standard Test Lessons*. The Reading Ease formula correlated .70 with the McCall-Crabbs criterion\
Most formulas have also been tested against other reading comprehension tests geared more toward adults.\

\
That, a large number of readers were given a passage of text and then asked various questions about that text to determine how well it was understood. Passages of text in which a high percentage of test takers got most of the questions correct are assumed to be "easier"; passages with fewer right answers are assumed to be harder. Readability formulas were then applied to that text and \
The earliest studies showing correlation between readability scores and text comprehension were based on \
McCall-Crabbs *Standard Test Lessons*. These tests involved a series of 376 passages for children, each of which included ten comprehension test questions to evaluate how well the test-taker had understood the piece of text. Grade-level reading ability was calibrated by how many questions were answered correctly---*i.e.*, more correct answers indicated higher reading ability. Klare tested the Flesch Reading Ease and Dale-Chall formulas against 16 standardised passages of the Ojemann tests and the 48 passages of the Gray and Leary tests, all developed for adult readers.\

After testing several components against benchmark measures of text comprehension, he eventually settled on a weighted average of sentence length and syllables per {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://1906F6DB-CAC6-48B7-A70A-CC6A5D04B4B8"}}{\fldrslt word.}}\

figure out the components of writing that contributed to readability. Flesch picked twenty-one magazines and divided them into five different levels of reading difficulty: Level A was the easiest and contained *Romantic Story*; level B (*e.g.*, *Redbook*); Level C (*e.g.*, *Reader's Digest*); Level E (*e.g.*, *Fortune*); and Level E (*e.g.*, *The American Scholar* and *The Yale Review*. He then counted the number of times several components of writing which had previously been found to correlate with reading comprehension in children were found in the different texts. He found that sentence length, the number of abstract words and the number of affixes had a high predictive value.\
Flesch connected several follow-up analyses using the McCall-Crabbs standardised test questions on reading materials\
In response to those concerns, public librarians, sought to recommend reading material of the appropriate grade level to adults. In an effort to help the large numbers of adults who were unable to read adn to provide the needed research on the area of writing readable books, the American Association for Adult Education formed the Readability Laboratory in 1936.\
In order to determine a way to produce readable material, Rudolf Flesch and the Laboratory's other researchers evaluated the exist\
The earliest measures of readability were simple counts of difficult {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://806745E6-B62B-4B03-812A-48BDE474E7EE"}}{\fldrslt words.}}\
Unfortunately, formulas using word lists had some definite problems when applied to adults. Most word lists had been developed for children. Adults, on the other hand, read more, had more experiences and just knew too many words. Moreover, even if a perfect and accurate word list exists, it still would not tell us which words were difficult to understand because of how they were used or because they were abstract to begin with.\
In response, [#Gray1935;] statistically tested numerous additional components that could be added to word lists to improve readability measures. \
were developed for this purpose. Unfortunately, most of these measures \
\
Though this is not quite the same as a journal\'92s peer-review process, it\'92s not quite a personal Word document uploaded to the internet, either. Because of that, economics working papers are regularly discussed by journalists, academics, and even policymakers before they\'92re formally published in a journal.\
Although this might be an issue if a non-standardised repository of draft papers were used, this is not likely to have a huge confounding effect on papers released as NBER drafts. NBER Working Papers are high profile releases of draft papers before being published in order to encourage discussion and suggestions for revision before publications. However, the long list of acknowledgements on NBER working papers---and, in particular, that overlap with the acknowlegements in the actual paper---suggests that the papers have undergone a thorough form of internal peer review---by friends and colleagues of the authors---before it is released as an NBER working paper.\
\
\
I worry that we cannot conclusively attribute changes in readability that occur between the NBER working paper and the published paper to the referee process. Some plausible alternative explanations are that male and female authors differ in the following ways: (i) how likely it is that they send the working paper out for comments, (ii) who they send the paper to for comments (might women send the paper to women more often, who perhaps are more likely to\
focus on writing quality if they are ex-ante better writers?), and (iii) how they respond to those comments that they do receive.\
\
long before they were released as NBER Working Papers and, combined with the evidence presented in [](#figure7), long before they were submitted to a journal. In additiona, most papers thank several economic congerences and their participants\
The other thing critics brought up is that Doleac and Mukherjee\'92s article is not yet peer reviewed\'97they plan to submit it to journals soon. But this, too, is an important difference between economics and some other types of health research. Economists tend to put out working papers and circulate them among colleagues long before they submit to journals. For example, Doleac and Mukherjee\'92s paper thanks several economic conferences and their participants in its acknowledgments. These colleagues\'97sometimes in pressure-cooker-esque seminars\'97ask questions and make suggestions, after which the paper is revised, then submitted.\
\
Thus, if the data from *

One could also include in that designation papers with a female first author. I therefore designate the lead author has he who was listed first in a paper in which authors were listed non-alphabetically or he was listed as the "corresponding author" or "lead author" in the acknowledgements. Unfortunately, however, this added only another 35 (0.38 percent) "female" observations.\
\
Moreover, conducting the analysis in [][Matching] would mean restricting the sample to only those women with at least three 100% female-authored papers; there are only 22, and only an additional 26 women have two. Indeed, 26% of female authors with at least three top publications have always authored with at least one man.

The gender of an author can be usually inferred from authors' given names. In the case of unisex and certain foreign first names, the high profile nature of NBER researchers and their articles probably mean most referees of these papers are aware of the gender of an author.\

I assume authors are granted authorship credit if and only if they have participated sufficiently in the work to take responsibility for the content.\
Unlike the more inclusive measure (at least one female author), female ratio captures the inherent uncertainty from both events: the probability a paper was written by a female co-author is zero or one---and referees' beliefs are presumably correct---when papers are either entirely written by men or women, respectively. Mixed gendered papers, however, are assigned a probability that (i) and (ii) are true based on the proportion of women listed as authors.\

Consistent with [](#table7), readability may actually decline during peer review. As discussed in [][NBER], this may be an artifact specific to abstracts, which are edited for length in addition to readability. Alternatively, writing (too) well upfront satisfies the review group with the highest initial readability threshold. Because referee reports reveal $s$ (and therefore $\\widetilde R_i^s$), a readability decline after receiving an R&R indicates that a majority of groups have laxer standards. This explanation is consistent with the theoretical model in [][SEUModel].

Moreover, the extent that higher standards require time investments and induce broader behavioural adjustments that reduce the quantity of female output, they may even produce superficial productivity measures that mask their effect. \
This conclusion suggests that controlling for productivity in estimates of gender earnings and promotion gaps may underestimate labour market discrimination unless those measures adjust for differences in standards.\
Moreover, the extent that higher standards require time investments and induce broader behavioural adjustments that reduce the quantity of female output, they may even produce superficial productivity measures that mask their effect. \
Performance is important, \
Given women are prone to adjust behaviour in anticipation of these higher standards, even measures that appear highly objective are likely affected by them; estimates of gender gaps in career outcomes that control for performance may therefore underestimate labour market discrimination.\
\
More broadly, these findings suggest that tougher standards in arbitrary dimensions reduce female productivity. They highlight that using performance measures to understand gender gaps in career outcomes likely underestimates---or even altogether misses---instances of gender discrimination in the labour market. Thus narrowly focusing public policies on increasing female productivity---e.g. by encouraging men to shoulder a larger portion of childcare responsibilities or promoting flexible work schedules---may not be sufficient to achieve gender equality in the workforce.\
By meeting discriminatory editorial standards before submission, the readability gap between senior, productive economists could appear independent of peer review in naive estimations.\
\
Earlier in their careers, women know less about referee expectations. [](#figureA1) suggests they *underestimate* those expectations, and, consequently, revise more during peer review. Draft readability at $t=2$ suggests \
make greater revisions during the process. suggesting women adapt behaviour and choices earlier in their career, where the learning curve is steeper. Later in their careers, when they're better informed, women's choices settle into a more stable pattern.

The difference is not significant and the sample of women with 4 or more publications is very small (see [][SEUEmpirical]). Nevertheless, a fall in readability (on average) during peer review is consistent with [](#Theorem1). Writing (too) well upfront satisfies a minority of review groups who discriminate by desk rejecting (relatively) poorly written female-authored papers. Once past desk rejection, however, the review group is "revealed" (recall that the author recognises groups that reviewed his earlier papers even though the identities of the groups' individual members remain unknown to him). In the majority of instances, this reveals that the group is non-discriminatory, so women relax their writing when making revisions. In this case, women's decline in readability between draft and published versions at $t=4\\text\{--\}5$ and $t=6+$ could indicate that only a minority of reviewers discriminate.

This paper makes a curious discovery: female-authored articles in top economics journals are better written. After examining the difference, I conclude that higher standards applied by editors and/or referees are primarily to blame.\
\
Moreover, if this effect were due entirely to women continuing to make mistakes about referee expectations at $t=3$, we should expect that a minority of men are also as sensitive as women---and so the mistakes they make are of a similar magnitude. That is, the mistakes made by the men in panel two fo [](#table10X) would be of a similar magnitude to those in panel one---just that they are made by fewer men. Yet they are not---on average, men that are discriminated against write only 20 percent more clearly than they otherwise would. This is a difference of nine percent. It seems highly unlikely that the women listed in [][AppendixMatchingNames]---a higher proportion of whom are editors and/or assistant editors at the journals in question---would persist in making errors of this magnitude relative to the men listed in [][AppendixMatchingNames].\
\
This paper also suggests a novel technical instrument that may be used to overcome bias inherent in measures of subjective evaluation. In the presence of higher standards, subjective quality measures are themselves biased. I use readability formulas to overcome this problem. Readability formulas are transparent, objective and accurate measures of one component on which papers are evaluated during peer review--writing clarity. Similar tests to expose higher quality work may uncover higher standards in a variety of situations: successful business proposals, published "letters to the editor" or annual report introductions. Readability scores could also be employed to produce more accurate measures of labour market wage gaps---by instrumenting for unobserved bias in the subjective productivity measures themselves. Readability scores have their limitations 
\f2 \cf4 [
\f0 \cf0 see
\f2 \cf4 ][MeasuringReadability]
\f0 \cf0  and their use in this manner applies to just a narrow set of questions. Nevertheless, they appear to be a largely ignored, naturally occurring source of pseudo-experiments relevant to research on gender or racial bias---and differential group treatment, more generally.

- Convergence if and only if signal is informative and agent uses signal to update posterior belief. Asymptotic learning fails if the correct action is not chosen (irrationality).\
- Smith and Sorenson (2000): when individuals observe all past actions and private beliefs are unbounded, information will be aggregated and the correct action will be chosen asymptotically.\
- Bounded beliefs: individuals copy past actions and/or completely ignore their own signals. (Why would men's beliefs be unbounded but women's beliefs bounded?)\
- Agents cannot (a) begin acting identically; (b) be subject to the same costs/rewards, (c) process signals in the same way (rationality), (d) yet end up on diverging paths. Even if we relax (a), and assume agents do not act identically---which does not correspond with what I find---assuming (b) and (c) means agents' paths remain a constant distance from one another.\
- Because it does not appear that women are rewarded differently for better writing (women's acceptance rates are identical to men's and their review times longer), it must be that they have higher costs of writing poorly (again, because acceptance rates are identical to men's, the cost likely comes in more length peer review). This is equivalent to so-called "higher standards".\
- There are two reasonable rewards from writing well (or, conversely, costs from writing poorly). Acceptance rates are higher and/or review times are faster. Compared to men, women do not benefit from either: numerous studies show women are not published at higher rates; my own analysis suggests women's review times are substantially longer. This latter point, especially, indicates female authors are punished more for poorer writing and/or male authors are rewarded more for clearer writing. I find some evidence of both effects. Male-authored papers that are better written do indeed enjoy faster peer review times. Given fewer changes are made to their papers during peer review, this provides a rough (although not causal) indication that better initial writing in male-authored papers shortens the time men spend in peer review. It appears to have much less of an effect for women.\
Women are not rewarded for better writing's acceptance rates are identical to men's but their review times are longer. Thus suggests women are 
\f9\i not
\f8\i0  rewarded for better writing; instead, they are punished for poorer writing.\
- There is no asymptotic learning in networks with non-expanding observations (observe actions of finite subset of actors).\
- When private beliefs are unbounded and the network topology is expanding, then there will be asymptotic learning.\
- Note that female readability starts out identical to men's but then diverges.\

By comparing the two, influences unrelated to immediate peer review are isolated from those that are; assuming the former are not correlated with the latter's timing, a widening gap suggests a causal link---and therefore rules out some constant difference between the sexes in how well they write (holding all else equal), it would arise

Third, women's writing gradually gets better but men's does not. Between authors' first and third published articles, the gap grows by 12 percent. Evidence does not suggest senior female economists co-author with more women. Nor are initially bad female writers leaving academia. Instead, women appear to get better at writing as their careers progress, whereas men donot . Given that we've already established a causal link between the readability gap and peer review, then this indicates women are receiving a form of positive reinforcement than men are not receiving. That is, men and women are receiving separate signals in peer review.\
Combined with point two, this suggests gender differences in (i) biology/behaviour that manifests itself in peer review---for example, women are more sensitive to referee criticism---as well as (ii) knowledge about the advantages of writing well cannot resolve the gap. In a simple model of Bayesian updating, I show Agents cannot (a) be subject to the same costs/rewards, (b) be rational (i.e., both learn rationally and start off with the same belief sets---either both have bounded beliefs or both have unbounded beliefs) and (c) end up on paths that diverge over time. \

Additionally, this readability gap widens precisely while papers undergo peer review.\
Because better writing takes effort to compose, it likely prolongs female review time---indeed, I find female female-authored papers spend six months longer in peer review---and probably contributes to lower publishing rates.\
I explore many interpretations---*
\f9\i e.g.
\f8\i0 *, Are women more sensitive to criticism? Is better writing due to risk aversion? Do women's papers deserve more scrutiny because they aren't as good?

\fs28 PARAGRAPH ON SPENDING 6 MONTHS LONGER IN PEER REVIEW\
Two possible explanations can account for this gap: either referees subject female-authored papers to added scrutiny, or women choose themselves to exert more effort. Both possibilities imply women spend more time than men on a given task. On the positive side, it increases quality; on the other hand, it reduces quantity. Either could explain academia's "Publishing Paradox". Unequal time spent making revisions leads to unequal time conducting new research; as a result, women write fewer papers.\
Nevertheless, I find the more plausible explanation is indeed because referees subject female-authored papers to greater scrutiny. First, women's writing gradually gets better but men's does not---meaning gender differences in (i) biology/behaviour and/or (ii) knowledge about the advantages of writing well cannot resolve the gap. According to both interpretations, readability essentially diverges because women voluntarily accept the costs of good writing (longer drafting and revision stages) despite receiving no tangible benefit (acceptance rates do not {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://2CBCA0AC-F93D-4327-9D70-A064EC32F38D"}}{\fldrslt change).}} Initially, this explanation is perfectly plausible; indefinitely, it is not: wouldn't individual women eventually figure out there's nothing to gain by writing well---and then do it {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://BBECB810-6583-4AC6-A216-A8B98DA17E33"}}{\fldrslt less?}} If so, gender differences in readability should decline as authors gain experience in peer review.\
Instead, they increase. Between authors' first and third published articles, the gap grows by 12 percent. Evidence does not suggest senior female economists co-author with more women. Nor are initially bad female writers leaving academia. Instead, women---and only women---seem to figure out that writing well makes peer review smoother; they write subsequent papers clearer from the start.\
Points one to three provide strong evidence that peer review is at least partially responsible for better writing in female-authored papers. But is it given that female-authored papers invite undue scrutiny? In [][alternatives], I explore several alternative hypotheses---many of which have nothing to do with bias and some that exonerate peer review, too. Among them: Are female economists disproportionately native English speakers? Are female referees the toughest critics, and, if so, are they more likely to review female-authored papers? Do manuscripts written by women deserve more criticism because they aren\'92t as good?\
As [][Alternatives] also illustrates, however, the only straightforward explanation consistent with the data is that referees are disproportionately critical of female-authored papers. Clearer sentences, less jargon and more scrutiny aren\'92t bad things.

To the extent that higher standards require time investments and induce similar behavioural adjustments that reduce the quantity of female output, they may even produce superficial productivity measures that mask their effect. \
\
women appear to have figured out how well they need to write---and they are doing all the hard work of writing well upfront. This suggests female economists gradually anticipate higher standards *in* peer review---and consequently write future papers more clearly *before* peer review.\
There is no gender difference in readability in the draft version of authors' first publication---although a significant difference has emerged by the time those articles are eventually published. Initial drafts of women's second publication, however, are already better written than men's---although the still further widens during peer review.  \
how stereotypes form or \
the source of discrimination---taste-based, attention, pollution---\
Indeed, many theories could explain *why* women are discriminated against in peer review---taste-based, attention, pollution, or any number of theories on how stereotypes form. The fact that it occurs, however, has important implications on how women behave. \
\
Its findings confirm similar conclusions in research on employee performance reviews, teaching evaluations and online comments---women receive more abusive feedback, less credit for intelligence and creativity and are expected to be more organised, prepared and clear[#Boring,2015,Correll2016,Gardiner2016)\
\
, thereby masking the effect of discrimination. \
Indeed, irrespective of the theory behind *why* referees and/or editors discriminate against women---and there may bewomen are held to higher standards\
Moreover, I find evidence that when facing discrimination, \
\
I find that women not only write more clearly when expected to do so---but also the way they do this can actually make these contortions resemble voluntary choice. This suggests women may modify their behaviour in ways that superficially mask the effect of discrimination by making their contortions resemble voluntary choice. \
\
Many of these differences are undoubtedly influenced by innate gender differences in biology and behaviour. Irrespective of their origin, however, most have intrinsic value that, under normal circumstances should be appropriately rewarded in an unbiased marketplace. Property listed by female real estate agents sell for higher prices; in the absence of higher standards, women would charge more to sell a house. They do not[#Trulia2011]. Patients treated by female physicians are less likely to die or be readmitted to hospital, in the absence of higher standards, visiting a female doctor would cost more. It does not[#XXXXXX]. Congresswomen are better legislators; in the absence of higher standards, they would be elected at higher rates. They are not[#XXXX]. Female-authored manuscripts are better written; in the absence of higher standards, women's papers would be published in academic journals at higher rates. They are not[#Ceci2014].\
\
Or, basically, women don't expect to be treated any differently than men in peer review. Unsurprisingly, then, for the first paper, the gap in readability emerges entirely during peer review. But women are obviously learning that that their papers need to be more readable than they originally expected. So next time around, they write more clearly from the outset. \
directly---referees spend more time evaluating women\'92s papers and women spend more time responding---and indirectly---female authors take longer drafting future papers. Both factors prolong peer review\
The pre- and post-review analysis using NBER working papers provides evidence of the first effect. I find further evidence of the direct effect in review times at *
\f3\i Econometrica
\f0\i0 *, where \
\
\
But assuming authors do not *want* to be poorly informed or oversensitive, their impact on choices declines with experience. the impact of this mistake declines with experience\

. Holding acceptance rates constant, this implies that a widening readability gap between authors with equivalent e\
women write more readably (and men possibly less so)\
Thus, if women write more readably (and men even less so) after enough time has passed, \
authors who increase readability are motivated entirely by higher acceptance rates\
women may miscalculate referee expectations and misconstrue their reports, but with experience they correct these mistakes. \
If an author has previously written a less readable paper and if she could obtain an identical expected acceptance rate at that same readability, she would.\
Since increasing readability is motivated by an author's belief that it increases acceptance rates,\
 change in readability can only be motivated by an author's belief that it increases acceptance rates. Together these factors imply that if the gap is actually wider after enough time has passed for beliefs to converge---but acceptance rate's aren't---then women because they have to. They'd be rejected, otherwise.\
\
Earlier, we measured the direct effect, which is basically the change in readability that occurs during peer review. This is women expending effort addressing direct referee concerns during peer review. There is also an indirect effect, however, in that \
 I find the direct effect dominates among early career academics; the indirect effect dominates later in their careers. \
It appears to dominate in papers written by early career academics. In fact, there is very little gender difference in readability in the draft version of an authors' first publication---although a large difference does emerge by the time those same articles are actually published. The indirect effect---i.e., women spending more time upfront drafting their papers---increasingly dominates as women gain experience in peer review.\
---and indirectly---female authors take longer drafting future papers. \
Moreover, I find evidence in the indirect effect in a supplemental pre- and post-review analysis using NBER working papers.\
\
The data on draft papers and final papers allows us to identify these two effects over time. We see that men and women draft their papers with identical readability at the beginning of their careers. This indicates that they initially anticipate the same writing standards and they write their papers accordingly.\
\
\
Unequal time spent making revisions leads to unequal time conducting new research; as a result, women write fewer papers. \
Moreover, they that I argue characterise many instances of female output---and may therefore explain lagging female productivity, wages and promotion rates, more generally.\
\
The robustness of these conclusions is obviously sensitive to the assumptions I have made. The two primary identifying assumptions are (i) $t=3$ is large enough to eliminate gender differences in expectations and (ii) $i$ and $k$ are truly {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://AC96CC82-BEBC-4EED-92B2-EE1D07095FB7"}}{\fldrslt equivalent.}} But the accuracy of these conclusions also depends on how I have modelled authors' utility. Specifically, authors probably care about getting their papers accepted and they may care about writing well, but their marginal utility from the intersection of the two events---*
\f3\i i.e.
\f0\i0 *, higher utility from writing well *
\f3\i only
\f0\i0 * because the paper is published in a top-four journal (as opposed to field journals or second-tier general interest journals)---is assumed to be negligible. For this reason, the impact of author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0 's personal utility from writing well is reflected only in the first stage when choosing 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0 ; it is otherwise irrelevant for the second phase, when choosing 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{1it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . If, on the other hand, women (and not men) *only* care about readability when their papers are published in the very top journals---as opposed to field journals or second-tier general interest journals---*and* wrote initially more poorly because (i) conditional on receiving an R&R, they overestimated $\\widetilde R_\{it\}$ *but* because of risk aversion simply refused to make the changes---and were pleasantly surprised when they were accepted anyway. But then the next time they are assigned $s$, they know $\\widetilde R_\{it\}$. And this is below some threshold; and they enjoy\
\
\
Women are more risk averse{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://135BB0D4-6A88-4975-8F9A-995F839A9629"}}{\fldrslt [see, *
\f3\i e.g.
\f0\i0 *,\\]\\[][#Borghans2009]}}---could that play a role? Consider revision rounds as lotteries. An author\'92s labour reveals his willingness to pay to reduce risk, so a positive link between risk aversion and better writing implies risk averse individuals exert more effort (on average) to reduce their odds of being {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://50C7D2A7-663E-40BD-861D-849F8A8D3A71"}}{\fldrslt rejected.}} Under these conditions, risk aversion leads to higher acceptance rates, all else equal.\
So if female authors truly are more risk averse than men, their papers would---and, indeed *
\f3\i should
\f0\i0 *---be disproportionately represented in academic journals. This is not the case. To the best of my knowledge, publication outcomes expose no female advantage, anywhere, ever

\f0 \cf0 for an overview of the literature, see, *
\f3\i e.g.
\f0\i0 *
\f2 \cf5 \\]\\[][#Ceci2014]
\f0 \cf0 . Meaning risk aversion either doesn't play a role, or conceals acceptance rates that unfairly favour men.\

In

It also suggests that experience teaches women to write more readably---and men less so---thus creating or exacerbating the gender readability gap.\
\
Assuming women do not rationally waste time writing so well---and their earlier, more poorly written papers suggest they're happy enough writing less clearly---[](#Theorem1) suggests that external forces beyond women's control is shaping decisions to write so well. To confirm this, however, requires looking at matched pairs for whom all three conditions are satisfied [simultaneously](#table10X).\

As discussed in the previous section, every article examined in this paper was published in top economics journals, precluding gender analysis of acceptance rates. Nevertheless, u\
\
Although I cannot directly determine acceptance rates with my data, mean $T$ (lifetime number of publications) do not suggest women are actually *rewarded* for their effort: on average, the women in the sample published 4.53 lar; men had 5.61. Coupled with the discussion in the previous section, thus suggests female-authored papers are accepted no more often than male-authored papers. So

\f0 \cf0  again supports 
\f2 \cf4 [](#Theorem1)
\f0 \cf0 's conclusion that women receive harsher scrutiny or are allocated harder critics in peer review.\

Consider a matched pair for which Conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied, suggesting discrimination against 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0 . The raw estimate of final gender difference in readability is 
\f2 \cf2 $R_\{i3\}-R_\{k3\}$
\f0 \cf0 . This reflects actual discrimination only if author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0  would otherwise voluntarily choose readability 
\f2 \cf2 $R_\{k3\}$
\f0 \cf0  if the probability of acceptance at that readability were identical to her probability of acceptance at readability $R_\{i3\}$. If $R_\{k3\}>R_\{i1\}$, then this is true: $R_\{i1\}$ forms an upper bound on the choice of readability author $i$ would make in the absence of peer review---*i.e.*, left to her own devices, we know author $i$ would choose some $R\\le R_\{i1\}$. If $R_\{k3\}<R_\{i1\}$, however, then we do not know if $i$ would otherwise voluntarily choose readability $R_\{k3\}$ if the probability of acceptance at that readability were identical to her probability of acceptance at readability $R_\{i3\}$---we only know that if that statement were true, she would choose no higher readability than $R_\{i1\}$.\
The purpose of Condition 2 is subtle. It rules out the possibility that women just intrinsically prefer writing more clearly than men or enjoy a lower cost of writing. Yet any such intrinsic preference or cost explanation defines the minimum readability at which a women is willing to write. Thus, *all* of her papers, including the most poorly written one, is at least this readability level. Because women will always choose a readability level that satisfies this minimum threshold dictated by their preference, any *increase* in readability must be driven by something else---*i.e.*, either their own mis-information or sensitivity or by factors outside their control.\
\
It is also possible to generate a conservative measure of the average effect of discrimination over all matched pairs in which one member satisfies Conditions 2 and 3---and thus, determine whether the average effect leans against men or women. This is the average of the following figure: $$D_i=\\bm1_i\\big(R_\{i3\}-\\max\\left\\\{R_\{i1\},R_\{k3\}\\right\\\}\\big),$$ where $\\bm1_i$ equals 1 if the author is female and -1 if the author is male.\
\
For each author, reconstructed readability scores differ only by experience: $$R_\{i3\}-R_\{i1\}=-\\mu_\{i1\} + \\Delta\\,\\varepsilon_\{i1\}.$$ Between matched pairs, they differ on female ratio *and* preferences:  $$R_\{i3\}-R_\{k3\}=\\beta_1+\\Delta\\,\\alpha_\{ik\} + \\Delta\\,\\varepsilon_\{ik3\}.$$ Assume both conditions are satisfied. But if $R_\{i3\}>R_\{i1\}$, then $i$ $\\alpha_i<\\alpha_k$, and $R_\{i3\}-R_\{k3\}$ underestimates $\\beta_1$. If $R_\{i1\}>R_\{i3\}$ then $\\mu_\{i1\}<0$. If at $t=3$ authors $i$ and $k$ enjoy identical acceptance rates at $R_\{i3\}$ and $R_\{k3\}$ and there were no bias, then they'd also enjoy identical acceptance rates at $R_\{i1\}<R_\{i3\}$. Given his prior decision history, $i$ would prefer to set readability lower than $R_\{i3\}$. The only reason he *wouldn't* is because he *can't*---not without suffer a lower probability of acceptance. Thus, $-\\mu_\{i1\}>0$ is a conservative estimate of $\\beta_1$.\

These results strongly suggest a causal interpretation of peer review's impact on the gender readability gap. According to all five scores, the readability of female-authored papers grew relative to male-authored papers precisely when these papers were undergoing peer review; the difference is highly significant for two scores and weakly significant for a third. When explicitly controlling for papers' draft readability, the readability gap persists and is highly significant for all five scores. Although it is premature to specify the exact mechanism that induces the gap's formation, these results nevertheless provide strong evidence that the mechanism emerges during peer review.

While the question of gender differences in peer review feedback may be new, the general question of whether women receive harsher feedback is not. The findings in this paper confirm conclusions from recent research on employee performance reviews and teaching evaluations.
\fs24 \

\fs28 The contribution of this paper is threefold. Its primary contribution is to shed light on the peer review *process*. To the best of my knowledge, my study is the first not only to suggest bias could exist in the process despite its absence in the outcome, but also to document such evidence.
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
First study of process. to the best of my knowledge, it is the first study to document evidence of gender bias in the peer review process. As mentioned earlier, gender has no apparent impact on journal acceptance rates. But a gender neutral outcome does not preclude a gender neutral *process*---and to the best of my knowledge, my paper is the first to suggest it. Determining whether female economists are unfairly scrutinised in referee reports suffers from several identification issues, chief among them the fact that accessing those reports is impossible thanks to the privacy ensconced in peer review. To circumvent this limitation, my paper notes that *if* women are subject to greater scrutiny, and that added scrutiny.
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
I concentrate on the third hypothesis: do reviewers require clearer, more concise writing from women than they do men? For, if referees hold female- and male-authored papers to identical standards, the latter should be just as coherently written as the former. My identification strategy is effectively a process of elimination. I first establish that the readability gap exists. I next establish a causal link between the timing of peer review and formation (or widening) of the gap. Finally, I document numerous stylised facts about the gap that a coherent theory would need to account for.
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
Given the well-documented human tendency to discount female competency, it should certainly not be used as proof that the wider system is completely fair.
\fs24 \

\fs28 Given the well documented human tendency to discount female competency, it is reassuring to know that at least journal acceptance rates are gender neutral. But as this paper illustrates, a gender neutral outcome does not preclude bias in the process---and it should not be used as a definitive proof that the wider system is completely fair. Instead, what it highlights is a neutrality precisely where neutrality is easy to measure but non-neutrality where it isn't. Other research has illustrated that neutrality is quickly and easily achieved when measurement is easy and monitoring is frequent. The findings in this paper support those conclusions---and suggests that to really root out bias, we need to improve monitoring and transparency in the peer review process, possibly by adopting open review, as discussed in [][p3openreview].
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
I believe it is the first to identify group differences using readability scores. As discussed in [][p3measuring_readability], these scores are highly correlated with reading comprehension, cheaper than audit studies and randomised controlled trials and arguably more objective than survey data. Using readability in this context obviously applies to a narrow set of research questions and cannot replace these traditional methods; they nevertheless reflect a complementary research tool that untaps a largely ignored, naturally occurring source of pseudo-experiments. A similar approach may (or may not) uncover similar group differences in business proposals, letters to the editor printed in newspapers, student essays, etc.

\f5\fs20 \cf0 In fact, there is no significant gender difference in abstract readability for authors' first publication in the data---papers initially composed without prior exposure to top journals' refereeing process. This finding further supports a causal link to peer review. Since readability scores are more gender neutral for first time publications, the gap is unlikely fully explained by either the residual impact of stricter writing standards for women at an earlier stage in their education or inherent gender differences in writing clarity. For, if either were true, a significant persistent gender difference should be present regardless of previous publication counts---and especially in the one with the largest sub-sample.

\fs24 \

\fs28 \
More generally, this study augments recent research linking gender pay and promotion differentials to productivity by showing men are held to lower evaluation standards. As expected, women adjust to this favouritism by raising the quality of their output, thereby increasing the time required to complete a task. If the marginal cost of this adjustment exceeds its benefit, female productivity will decline. 
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
These statistics are uncomfortable, but their causes are myriad: lower publishing rates, career choices, motherhood and, probably, bias. In lab experiments women are subject to tougher standards. Their qualifications and ability are underestimated\cf5 [#Foschi1996,Grunspan2016,Moss-Racusin2012,Reuben2014]\cf0 .

\fs28 Peer review is not immune. Using five reliable measures of writing clarity, I show that female-authored articles published in top economics journals are better written than similar papers by men; the simplest interpretation is that editors and referees expect clearer, more direct writing from women.

\f8\fs28 \cf0 Policy has responded by encouraging more flexible work hours, better paid and longer maternity leave and greater nursery care options. These policy responses are important; but the analysis of submit-accept times suggests women without any family constraints take the longest in peer review. This suggests current policy interventions may have very little impact on the gender and earnings gap in academia. To the extent that women face similar higher standards in other high-skilled occupations, these findings therefore suggest such policy interventions will do little to increase female representation in senior positions. This emphasis on schedules and child-rearing has shifted focus from cases of actual discrimination witnessed heretofore mainly in the lab---women's qualifications are underestimated, they are evaluated more critically and when collaborating with men, women are given less credit---to external factors independent of the firm. To the extent that it has highlighted the challenges and responsibilities hoisted on the typical working mother, it may even have unintentionally reinforced the gender wage gap by attributing pay differentials caused by discrimination to external factors beyond the firm's controls, effectively creating a convenient justification for lower wages that may actually have been caused by discrimination.

 and reduces research output, academia's benchmark for pay and promotion. Thus while performance may be an important to explaining the underrepresentation of women in economics, at least equally important is how we judge that performance. 
\fs24 \

\fs28 Moreover, women's permanent behavioural adjustment accumulates at a rate of X% per paper, meaning the gender readability gap mirrors wage dynamics in many high-skilled occupations[#Bertrand2009]. Higher standards may therefore contribute to women's general underrepresentation in senior positions.
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
\
\
Moreover, my results suggest a possible link between higher standards and the gradual increase of the gender wage gap with age. I find the readability gap does not decline with seniority---*i.e.*, women are subject to higher standards throughout their careers. By limiting the rate at which women accrue publications, they generate a wage and promotion gap that widens as economists age.
\fs24 \

\fs28 This limits the rate at which women accumulate publications, and leads to a widening gap in accrued publications Because academic pay is generally determined by researchers\'92 aggregate publication counts, this phenomena may explain why the gender wage and promotion gap is widest between well-published, senior economists.

This increases the time required to write a paper. Female productivity again declines.

\fs24 \

\fs28 Given women are prone to adjust behaviour in anticipation of these higher standards, even measures that appear highly objective are likely affected by them; estimates of gender gaps in career outcomes that control for performance may therefore underestimate labour market discrimination.
\fs24 \

\fs28 Longer reviews limit the number of papers a woman can write in her lifetime.
\fs24 \

\fs28 This increases time between a paper's inception and its publication and limits the number of papers a woman can write. Assuming research productivity measures do not commensurately reflect higher standards, female productivity will remain artificially low. This may resolve academia's "Publishing Paradox".
\fs24 \

\fs28 This paper sheds light on gender differences in productivity.
\fs24 \

\fs28 Lower productivity due to higher standards provides a novel explanation for women's underrepresentation in economics departments. Mirroring most professions, female economists are less likely to make tenure, take longer when they do and earn much less than their male peers[#Bandiera2016,Ceci2014,Ginther2004,Sarsons2015]. These patterns persist despite appropriate controls for individual and work characteristics, and for at least a decade, they nave not declined. 
\fs24 \

\fs28 I find papers by both sexes are altered during peer review; the changes made to female-authored papers, however, are far more substantial and are positively correlated with the length of time spent in peer review
\fs24 \

\fs28 The results demonstrate that a gender neutral outcome does not preclude a gender neutral *process* that can still bias the outcome in unintended ways.
\fs24 \

\fs28 This conclusion indicates that instances of gender discrimination may have been underestimated in the past.\

\fs24 \

\fs28 This conclusion suggests that controlling for productivity in estimates of gender earnings and promotion gaps may underestimate labour market discrimination unless those measures adjust for differences in standards.
\fs24 \

\fs28 The readability formulas used in this analysis provide a transparent, objective and accurate measure of higher standards---albeit in only the narrow dimension of writing clarity.
\fs24 \

\fs28 This increases the time between a paper's inception and publication and decreases the number of papers women can write. Assuming expending effort on writing well is not commensurately rewarded in measures of research productivity, female productivity will appear lower than it is.
\fs24 \

\fs28 If higher standards for female output do not increase its value---*e.g.*, better writing does not impact tenure and pay decisions---female productivity will decline. 
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
Unless women are accurately compensated for this tax on their time and resulting quality of their output, they will appear less productive---an obvious disadvantage when employers rely on imperfect measures to make hiring and promotion decisions.

While performance is important, what's also important is how we judge performance. The readability formulas used in this analysis are transparent, objective and accurate measures of writing clarity. An important advantage of readability formulas is that they establish an objective measure of quality that changes with referee subjectivity. Publication in a top economics journal is a transparent and comprehensive indicator of performance. Combining these measures therefore produces a productivity measure that transparently reflects the *actual* productivity of women. Such a measure may prove a potent instrument to correct for estimates of gender gaps in career outcomes that control for performance.

\fs28 This research also adds to other recent studies that have shown that women are held to different, usually higher, standards than men in the workplace. Although writing standards are the focus here, prior research suggests women and men are held to separate standards beyond this narrow dimension.
\fs24 \

\fs28 This research also contributes to the recent research on the impact of stereotypes. Its findings confirm similar conclusions in research on employee performance reviews, teaching evaluations and online comments---women receive more abusive feedback, less credit for intelligence and creativity and are expected to be more organised, prepared and clear\cf5 [#Boring2015,Correll2016,Gardiner2016]\cf0 .

\fs28 These findings also emphasise the role transparency and monitoring play in reducing discrimination. Journal acceptance rates are easy to measure and frequently auditing; both factors foster accountability, which in turn encourages gender neutrality[#Foschi1996].

\cf0 Women in many high-skilled professions appear less productive than men[#Ceci2014,Xie2005,Ecklund2011,Azmat2016]. Unfortunately, there are relatively few studies that provide compelling explanations for these productivity differences: productivity gaps remain despite accounting for children, responsibilities and hours worked.
\fs24 \

\fs28 Instead, this paper suggests that academia's primary yardstick of productivity---the number of articles published in top journals---is distorted during peer review. Using several objective measures of writing quality, I show that editors and referees in top economics journals expect clearer, more direct writing from women. As a consequence, two factors emerge to reduce female productivity: (i) female-authored papers spend more time in peer review; and (ii) women start writing subsequent papers clearer upfront in anticipation of referee criticism.
\fs24 \

\fs28 \
More broadly, these findings suggest that tougher standards in arbitrary dimensions reduce female productivity. They highlight that using performance measures to understand gender gaps in career outcomes likely underestimates---or even altogether misses---instances of gender discrimination in the labour market. Thus narrowly focusing public policies on increasing female productivity---e.g. by encouraging men to shoulder a larger portion of childcare responsibilities or promoting flexible work schedules---may not be sufficient to achieve gender equality in the workforce.\

Instead, women---and only women---apparently figure out that better writing makes peer review smoother; they write subsequent papers clearer from the start. This evidence is consistent with higher standards.\

There is no evidence selection effects are behind the [trend][p3ExperienceExplanation]. Senior female economists do not co-author with more women and senior male economists do not co-author with more men. (In fact, senior economists regardless of gender publish more often with members of the opposite sex than they did as juniors.) It is also not true that initially bad female writers (or initially good male writers) disproportionately leave academia: the readability of an author's first paper has zero predictive power on how often he (or she) eventually publishes in a top four economics journal.\

\f0 \cf0 , given 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . Section X investigates the relationship between 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0  and 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{1it\}$
\f0 \cf0 , and correspondingly discusses in more detail the initial screening process of papers and author's original choice of 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0 .\
The author submits the initial draft of his paper to a journal. There, it is assigned to the group of reviewers 
\f2 \cf2 $e\\in\\mathcal E$
\f0 \cf0 , where 
\f2 \cf2 $\\mathcal E$
\f0 \cf0  is the set of all review groups. Given the focus of the analysis, we have assumed that review group $e$ has already decided to invite the author to revise and resubmit his manuscript. At the same time, they have collectively decided that the paper should be published if and only if after revising the document, the paper's readability is at least 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}^e$
\f0 \cf0 . 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}^e$
\f0 \cf0  is a threshold on readability specific to the review group $e$; it depends on the characteristics of the paper---*
\f3\i e.g.
\f0\i0 *, topic, novelty and quality---journal and author; it may be prejudiced by the review group conditional on any of these factors.\
Unfortunately, the concept of readability is complex and ambiguous, meaning members of the review group cannot convey 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}^e$
\f0 \cf0  directly. Instead, they compile a "referee report" from which the author forms expectations about 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}^e$
\f0 \cf0  by assigning subjective probabilities 
\f2 \cf2 $\\mu_\{1it\}^e(R)$
\f0 \cf0  to all 
\f2 \cf2 $R\\in\\mathbb\{R\}$
\f0 \cf0 . 
\f2 \cf2 $\\mu_\{1it\}^e$
\f0 \cf0  depends on characteristics of the paper, journal and review group and may be biased by the author's interpretation of the referee report or his mis-information about peer review.\
The author's subjective expected utility from choosing readability 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{1it\}$
\f0 \cf0  given his initial choice 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0  is 
\f2 \cf2 $$\\mathrm\{\\widehat M\}_\{1it\}^e(R_\{it\})\\,u_\{i\}-c_\{1i|r_\{0it\}\}(r_\{1it\}),$$
\f0 \cf0  where 
\f2 \cf2 $\\mathrm\{\\widehat M\}_\{1it\}^e(R_\{it\})$
\f0 \cf0  is the sum of all 
\f2 \cf2 $\\mu_\{1it\}^e$
\f0 \cf0  such that 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}<R_\{it\}$
\f0 \cf0 , 
\f2 \cf2 $u_\{i\}$
\f0 \cf0  is the author's utility of having his paper accepted and 
\f2 \cf2 $c_\{1i|r_\{0it\}\}(r_\{1it\})$
\f0 \cf0  represents the cost of making changes 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{1it\}$
\f0 \cf0  given the paper's initial readability 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . 
\f2 \cf2 $c_\{1i\}$
\f0 \cf0  is increasing and convex in 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0  and 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{1it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . Marginally increasing 
\f2 \cf2 $R_\{it\}$
\f0 \cf0  generates proportionally less utility but requires proportionally more effort when the paper is already well written.\

\f2 \cf2 $u_i$
\f0 \cf0  is strictly positive and independent of 
\f2 \cf2 $R_\{it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . Authors probably care about getting their papers accepted and they may care about writing well, but their marginal utility from the intersection of the two events---*
\f3\i i.e.
\f0\i0 *, higher utility from writing well *
\f3\i only
\f0\i0 * because the paper is published in a top-four journal---is assumed to be negligible. For this reason, the impact of author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0 's personal utility from writing well is reflected only in the first stage when choosing 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0  (see Section X, where it is included as a specific element in the author's objective function); it is otherwise irrelevant for the second phase, when choosing

\cf0 In other words, women chose to make their papers more readable because they think it will improve the probability their papers are accepted. This does not imply that utility or risk aversion or whatever doesn't factor into women's choice of $R_\{it\}$. As long as writing more clearly means a higher probability of acceptance, a higher $u_j$ will indeed induce authors to write more clearly. Women may also be more responsive to referee criticism (reflected in a more pessimistic $\\mu_\{j0\}^e$ for all $\\widetilde R_j^e$), but it has to be accompanied by a higher probability of acceptance. Absent that, SEU rational agents will not choose $R_\{j\}>R_\{j\}'$.\
Do women get an advantage from writing more clearly? Theorem X is conditional on having received an R&R. That is, all women who receive an R&R and still write more clearly than men during the revision process expected a strictly higher probability of acceptance.\
This can explain a wide variety of behaviours. For example, women are more sensitive to referee criticism not because they enjoy being sensitive but because they *think* it is rewarded with a higher acceptance rate. Similarly, women may indeed be more risk averse---reflected in X by a higher instantaneous utility of acceptance---but if they choose to write more clearly, again, it was only because they *thought* it would improve their probability of acceptance.\
\
**Corrollary**. Assume $R_\{kt1\}$ and $R_\{it1\}$ satisfy Assumption (3) and $\\widehat\\mu_\{kt1\}(R_\{kt\})=\\widehat\\mu_\{it1\}(R_\{it\})$, where . Then there exists a $\\widehat\\Delta_\{ik\}(R_0)<0$ such that $$\\lim_\{t\\rightarrow\\infty\}\\Delta_\{ikt\}(R_0)\\longrightarrow\\widehat\\Delta_\{ikt\}(R_0)$$ almost surely.\
Yet readability *does not* improve the probability that women's papers are accepted. Although women's papers are indeed more readable, to my knowledge no prior investigation of gender bias in peer review has previously shown that women's papers were accepted at any *higher* rate than men's.\
Women might be more likely to choose a higher R if their utility or acceptance was higher or marginal costs were lower. But what Theorem X establishes is that that they don't do that for the hell of it---they are only going to write more clearly if comes with an additional benefit.\

The concept of readability is complex and ambiguous, meaning members of the review group cannot convey it directly. Instead, $e$ tries to convey this information in a referee report, denoted by 
\f2 \cf2 $\\rho_i^e$
\f0 \cf0 . The author uses the report $\\rho_i^e$ to form expectations about $\\widetilde R_i^e$ by assigning subjective probabilities $\\widehat\\mu_\{1it\}^\{\\rho_i^e\}(R)$ to all $R$. $\\widehat\\mu_\{1it\}^\{\\rho_i^e\}$ may be biased by the author's interpretation of the referee report or a skewed perception of peer review.\
 Authors, in turn, misconstrue even excellent reports when they are, *
\f3\i inter alia
\f0\i0 *, over- or under-confident in their paper's other qualities or excessively sensitive to low-probability events. Thus, the author's interpretation of the report is imprecise; the expectations he forms about $\\widetilde R_i^e$ can only be represented in the subjective probabilities $\\widehat\\mu_\{1it]^e(R)$ he assings to all $R$ after reading the report.\

It *also* implies that if author $i$ choses a higher readability than another author with an otherwise equivalent paper, then author $i$ anticipated a higher probability of acceptance, *ex ante*.\
\
\
that unless author $i$ chooses the same $r_\{0it\}$ and $R_\{it\}$ every single time period, \
Yet when he chooses to *change* his readability from one time to the next, that decision is driven by his desire to amp up his probability of acceptance.\
[](#theorem1) shows that if at time $t$ author choses $r_\{0it\}$ and $R_\{it\}$ but at some other time $t'$ he chose $r'<r_\{0it\}$ and $R'<R_\{it\}$, then the higher readability at time $t$ is driven exclusively by the author's desire to attain a higher acceptance rate. \
 author $i$'s *ex ante* subjective probability of being accepted given his optimal readability choices $r_\{0it\}$ and $R_\{it\}$ is never equal to (and strictly greater than) his subjective probability of acceptance at every other $r'<r_\{0it\}$ and $R'<R_\{it\}$.\
\
\
[](#theorem1) also implies that an increase in readability between time $t'$ and time $t$ was driven by the expectation of being rewarded for it with a higher acceptance probability. It *also* implies that if author $i$ chose a higher readability than another author with an otherwise equivalent paper, then author $i$ anticipated a higher probability of acceptance, *ex ante*.\
the optimal choice of readability is always linked to the probability of acceptance: although many reasons may factor into a woman's choice of $r_\{0it\}$ and $R_\{it\}$, but absent a higher acceptance rate, women do not increase\
women chose to make their papers more readable because they think it will improve the probability their papers are accepted. This does not imply that utility or risk aversion or whatever doesn't factor into women's choice of 
\f2 \cf2 $R_\{it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . As long as writing more clearly means a higher probability of acceptance, a higher 
\f2 \cf2 $u_i$
\f0 \cf0  will indeed induce authors to write more clearly. Women may also be more responsive to referee criticism (reflected in a more pessimistic 
\f2 \cf2 $\\pi_\{0it\}^s$
\f0 \cf0  for all 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}^s$
\f0 \cf0 ), but it has to be accompanied by a higher probability of acceptance. Absent that, SEU rational agents would prefer to choose a smaller 
\f2 \cf2 $R$
\f0 \cf0 .\
This can explain a wide variety of behaviours. For example, women are more sensitive to referee criticism not because they enjoy being sensitive but because they *
\f3\i think
\f0\i0 * it is rewarded with a higher acceptance rate. Similarly, women may indeed be more risk averse---reflected in X by a higher instantaneous utility of acceptance---but if they choose to write more clearly, again, it was only because they *
\f3\i thought
\f0\i0 * it would improve their probability of acceptance.\
\
But I'm also relatively certain that if I could get away with writing less readably, then I would.\
\
\
This does not imply that $u_i$, $\\phi_i$ and $c_i$ do non influence $r_\{0it\}$ and $R_\{it\}$. It does imply, however, that their influence should not be reinforced over timeFor their influence on readability to be *
\f3\i reinforced
\f0\i0 * however, they must bolster other *
\f3\i explicit
\f0\i0 * objectives. For example, sensitive authors do not become more sensitive unless that sensitivity is useful for achieving the explicit objectives in 
\f2 \cf4 [](#equationX1)
\f0 \cf0  or 
\f2 \cf4 [](#equationX2)
\f0 \cf0 . Thus, Indeed, if at any point he chooses to write his current paper more clearly than some previous paper, this choice was motivated by a higher ex ante subjective expected probability of acceptance. Absent that advantage, author $i$ prefers the smaller readability chosen previously.\

\f2 \cf2 $u_i$
\f0 \cf0 , 
\f2 \cf2 $\\phi_i$
\f0 \cf0  and 
\f2 \cf2 $c_i$
\f0 \cf0  remain constant over time. Thus, changes to $r_\{0it\}$ and $R_\{it\}$ imply changes in the subjective probabilities author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0  forms about 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0  and 
\f2 \cf2 $\\widetilde R_\{it\}$
\f0 \cf0 . Thus, when authors write current papers more readably than past or future papers, they do so because they expected to be rewarded for it with a higher probability of acceptance. Changes to the optimal choices 
\f2 \cf2 $r_\{0it\}$
\f0 \cf0  and 
\f2 \cf2 $R_\{it\}$
\f0 \cf0  are motivated entirely by a desire to achieve his other objective of getting his paper accepted into a prestigious academic journal.\
[](#theorem1) indirectly implies that if author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0  choses a higher readability than another author with an otherwise equivalent paper, then author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0  anticipated a higher probability of acceptance, *
\f3\i ex ante
\f0\i0 *. Of course, that doesn't mean author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0  is right---it is perfectly plausible that he's misinformed and there is no difference in their probabilities of acceptance. As 
\f2 \cf2 $t\\rightarrow\\infty$
\f0 \cf0  in a fixed state 
\f2 \cf2 $s$
\f0 \cf0  with perfect recall of his past histories or in any state with access to his peers' histories, author 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0  eventually figures this out.\
\
\
(For an overview of the literature, see, *
\f3\i e.g.
\f0\i0 *, 
\f2 \cf5 [#Ceci2014;]
\f0 \cf0 .) Thus, if female author's improve both improve their writing over time *
\f3\i and
\f0\i0 * persistently write more clearly then men, then 
\f2 \cf4 [](#Theorem1)
\f0 \cf0  implies that female authors suffer from a subtle form of discrimination. Either referee assignment is biased in favour of men---*
\f3\i i.e.
\f0\i0 *, journal editors disproportionately refer female-authored papers to the toughest critics---or referees are more critical of female-authored work.\
\
\
\
This suggests two simple empirical tests can establish if editorial standards and/or referee assignment beyond authors' control is driving the readability gap, or, instead, it's being driven by gender differences in biology/behaviour and/or knowledge about referee expectations.\
The first test \
\
[](#Theorem1) relies on two principle identifying assumptions: (i) [](#equationX1) and [](#equationX2) accurately reflect authors' objective functions; and (ii) men and women are accurately sorted into appropriate equivalence classes. If so, then The first identifying assumption is discussed at length in [](#Robustness). For the moment, I assume it is satisfied and focus instead on Conditions (1)--(3) under conditions in which the topic, novelty and quality of a paper is independent of gender.\
\
Thus, \
For either phenomena to cause a *
\f3\i persistent
\f0\i0 * readability gap, however, then female-authored papers will be disproportionately represented in academic journals.\
Under these conditions, female-authored papers should enjoy higher acceptance rates, all things equal.\
If they don't---*i.e.*, if Condition 1 is satisfied---then diligently addressing every referee concern has no apparent upside---acceptance rates are unaffected---and a very clear downside---constant redrafting takes time. In that case, women may indeed have a higher utlity or acceptance or simply be more risk averse\
In the absence of other reason to keep readability so high, rational women re-examine initial beliefs\'85 and then start \
When Condition 1 is satisfied, however, this behaviour cannot persist long-term. If women care more about being accepted, \
Persistent effort in the absence of any tangible reward requires systematic failure among women to efficiently allocate resources\
If women's hard work solely behind long-term readability differences, however, they must be rewarded with higher acceptance rates.\
For such gender differences in preferences to persist long term, however, \
 write more clearly in peer review. A gender readability gap---even one formed *during* peer review---could reasonably reflect gender differences in preferences. For example, more risk averse individuals or those with higher utility of acceptance might exert more effort (on average) to reduce their odds of being {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://7D190C8A-C8B3-4A04-BB4D-ED2421FF25DA"}}{\fldrslt rejected.}} They expect to be rewarded, however, with higher acceptance rates, all else equal. As a consequence, their papers would---and, indeed *
\f3\i should
\f0\i0 *---be disproportionately represented in academic journals. So gender differences in preferences lead to appropriate gender differences in outcomes.\
If better written female-authored papers are accepted at higher rates than more poorly written papers by otherwise equivalent male authors, then women are being rewarded for the time and effort they put into writing more clearly. The gender readability gap could reasonably reflect gender differences in the utility of acceptance. For example, women are more risk averse{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://078C03EB-9E34-4DAD-966F-E4BDCF8B1CE4"}}{\fldrslt [see, *
\f3\i e.g.
\f0\i0 *,\\]\\[][#Borghans2009].}} Consider revision rounds as lotteries. An author\'92s labour reveals his willingness to pay to reduce risk, so a positive link between risk aversion and better writing implies risk averse individuals exert more effort (on average) to reduce their odds of being {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://ACF96387-35BB-4F5D-980B-5E5BD09D702B"}}{\fldrslt rejected.}} Under these conditions, risk aversion leads to higher acceptance rates, all else equal. So if female authors truly are more risk averse than men, their papers would---and, indeed *
\f3\i should
\f0\i0 *---be disproportionately represented in academic journals. \
\
\
As for Condition 1: readability gap could emerge from underlying gender differences in 
\f2 \cf2 $u_i$
\f0 \cf0 : ambitious authors or those strongly averse to being rejected probably work harder to secure publications. Nevertheless, they eventually learn readability's true impact on rejection, so 
\f2 \cf2 $i$
\f0 \cf0 's unconditional probability of acceptance must be higher than 
\f2 \cf2 $k$

\f2 \cf2 $u_k<u_i$
