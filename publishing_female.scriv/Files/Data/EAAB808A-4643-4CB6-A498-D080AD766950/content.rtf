\f0\fs28 \cf0 Gender bias is possible only when authors' identity is known or can be reasonably guessed. Two factors make that feasible: non-blind review and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://88B0B53F-6291-4A40-B407-7F0478BBF00D"}}{\fldrslt Google.}} Do either exacerbate the readability gap between male- and female-authored abstracts?
