Is the answer double-blind review? Probably not. Double-blind review cannot stop referees from guessing authors' identities---which they did with surprising accuracy before the internet

\f0\fs28 , and presumably perfect accuracy after it.\
Instead, eliminate single-blind review, too. A randomised controlled trial at the *
